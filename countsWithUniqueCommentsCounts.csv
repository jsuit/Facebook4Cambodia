Congratulations to Cambodian #YSEALI member Sophanna, who was picked by President Obama to ask a question during the Presidents YSEALI Town Hall this afternoon in Luang Prabang, Laos. Sophanna asked the President about which of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals is most important. You can see the Presidents answer (ending poverty)  and the entire Town Hall  by following this link: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/president-obama-holds-yseali-town-hall-0.

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Okay.  So, Cambodia, we have somebody from Cambodia?  Right here, this young man.  By the way, everybody looks very good in their native clothes.  Those of you who are just wearing shirts, you look good too.  (Laughter.)  But I appreciate how nice everybody looks today.  Go ahead.
 
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  And actually my question was taken by one of the fellows, so I just start with the second question.  If the 17 goals of the SDG were implemented in the United States, which goals should be the top priority, and why is it?  And how you got to deal with it?  Thank you.  (Applause.)
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  That's a good question.  So for those of you who didn't hear the question, SDG is the Sustainable Development Goals that were an update on the original set of goals.  Keep in mind how much progress we've made on those goals over the last 20 years.
 
The number of people who we've seen rise out of extreme poverty, the number of people who are now able to have enough to eat, the reduction in infant mortality has been remarkable.  So we've made real progress.  Worldwide, people are much better off now than they were just 20 years ago, and I think we can make similar progress going forward.
 
I've actually asked our teams to look at where in these Sustainable Development Goals do we have work to do in the United States?  And although we're still evaluating that, I would say that the areas where we still fall short are -- there are still too many children in poverty in the United States.  Now, they're not suffering extreme poverty of the sort that you see in parts of India or China or Laos or Cambodia, but we have children who are very poor and who still aren't getting enough to eat.  That is also connected to education.  And we still have a lot of children in a country so wealthy that on a day-to-day basis are not getting the kinds of educational opportunities that they deserve.
 
So I would say that the way forward for us involves addressing those pockets of poverty, and starting with kids.  And we have enough wealth to do it.  The question is whether we have the political will to make the investments in these communities, many of which are in inner cities.  Oftentimes they are poor African American or Latino who are still held back historically by discrimination.  And sometimes it's harder to get the society as a whole to invest in these kids.
 
But if we're going to be successful, we're going to have to do it.  This goes to a question that was asked earlier -- the United States, by the year 2050 -- which is only 35 years from now -- will no longer be a majority-white country -- think about that -- because the birth rates for particularly people of Hispanic background, but also Asians, in American, is much faster, much higher. 
 
So if those kids today who are poor aren't provided opportunity, our society as a whole is going to be poorer, because that's going to be the workforce of the future.  And that's where I think we have to make the most progress.",2016-09-07,28.0

- From the Ambassador's Penh

Cambodia is known around the world for its amazing cultural patrimony, from archaeological sites to traditional folklore to Apsara Dance.  The U.S. government is a proud supporter of cultural heritage in Cambodia, particularly through the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation Program (AFCP).  Since 2001, Cambodia has received 16 AFCP grants totaling more than $2.3 million, which puts it in second place worldwide (after only Afghanistan).  That is a testament not only to Cambodias extraordinary cultural heritage but also to the many great partners that we work with, including the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, UNESCO, and many cultural institutions and NGOs.

One of our most recent AFCP projects is the mapping, documentation, and preservation of Angkorian sites on Phnom Kulen.  The project is being carried out by the Archaeology and Development Foundation  (ADF) in cooperation with the APSARA National Authority and the Ministry of Environment.  The project is led by Dr. Jean-Baptiste Chevance, who is working with an amazingly talented team of Cambodian archaeologists and workers.
Phnom Kulen is a sandstone plateau located 40 kilometers northeast of the Angkor Archaeological Park and Siem Reap town that has been considered sacred for at least a thousand years.  Phnom Kulen is famous today for the Preah Ang Thom pagoda and its reclining Buddha.  The area remained largely unexplored for a long period of time and contains a myriad of significant archaeological remnants  from sculpted riverbeds and caves to ancient waterworks and temples.

Since 2008, ADF has been carrying out a systematic archaeological study and mapping project.  In 2012, ADF began to use an airborne laser scanning technology called LiDAR with the help of the University of Sydney.  Using LiDAR, ADF was able to uncover an unprecedented urban network, confirming the existence of Mahendraparvata, the renowned capital of Jayavarman II that dates to the 9th century.  The U.S. governments AFCP grant has helped ADF to complete the inventory of previously unknown features and to protect the sites from destructive agricultural practices.  
In addition to preserving cultural heritage, AFCP programs also help to build local expertise.  Thanks to the Phnom Kulen project, ADF has been able to train five Cambodian archaeologists in ground surveying techniques and in the use of LiDAR and Global Positioning Satellites.  Cambodian staff also play a crucial role in building awareness by local residents about the work that is being done and how it supports their communities.

An ongoing challenge that conservationists face at Phnom Kulen (and elsewhere) is the threat of deforestation.  At Phnom Kulen National Park, only 20 percent of the original forest cover remains  much of the rest has been turned into cashew nut plantations.  This not only damages the environment, but it also destroys important archaeological evidence.  Illegal logging is also a continuing challenge to conservation efforts.  Considering Phnom Kulens cultural and scientific value, it is essential that we look for solutions to protect the resource, including alternative agricultural practices and tourism development.

I am extremely proud that the U.S. government is playing an important role in the study and preservation of Phnom Kulen, and we look forward to supporting new cultural preservation projects in the years to come.

When you picture Angkor Wat, you might think of the imposing and elegant temple surrounded by a thick forest of trees. However, archaeologists now know that when Angkor Wat was built, it was surrounded by a series of mounds that are likely places where people lived. Dr. Alison Kyra Carter, Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

    ?  Greater Angkor Project (GAP)   Sydney 

Much of what is known about life at Angkor Wat comes from inscriptions on stone temple structures, which only tell the stories of the elites. But what about the lives of the ordinary citizens who made Angkor one of the largest population centers of its time? This question is a topic of interest for the scientists of the Greater Angkor Project (GAP)  a joint initiative between the Apsara Authority  and the University of Sydney.

  GAP   Alison Kyra Carter            Carter   Khmer Times      Carter   https://kh.usembassy.gov//household-archaeology-angkor-wa/ 
(   )

Last year, a GAP team led by U.S. archaeologist Dr. Alison Kyra Carter and her colleague Chhay Rachna carefully excavated a single mound that scientists believe used to be the site of a household. This painstaking and difficult work led to some amazing new discoveries, which Dr. Carter wrote about in a recent essay first published in the Khmer Times. The archaeologists found evidence of household activities, including what the people ate and how they cooked their food.

The Easter Egg Roll at the White House is a 138-year-old tradition started by President Rutherford B. Hayes when he invited a group of young children to roll Easter eggs on the lawn. This year's event was a fun-filled day of activities including the egg-roll, musical performances, cooking demonstrations, celebrity appearances, fitness activities and more. 

The President and Mrs. Obama also took time to read the classic story Where the Wild Things Are to a group of young children. Watch the video and see them act out the characters from the book!

Speaking of media, a few days ago President Obama attended his final White House Correspondents Dinner. The annual event is traditionally attended by the President & First Lady and is famous for being the one night a year when the President is free to tell as many jokes as he can (often at his own expense). President Obama also had a serious message, taking time to thank the press for their work:

I know that there are times that weve had differences. But weve always shared the same goal  to root our public discourse in the truth; to open the doors of this democracy; to do whatever we can to make our country and our world more free and more just. And Ive always appreciated the role that you have all played as equal partners in reaching these goals.

On Monday morning, Professor Eric Pallant went to the Ministry of Environment and met with 30 officials from the Department of Pollution Control.  After a brief presentation by the Ministry about current strategies to control water pollution in Cambodia, Professor Pallant addressed some of the participants most pressing concerns and answered questions.  Among the items discussed was the question of how to address the discharge of harmful wastes from factories into nearby streams and rivers.  Professor Pallant explained how public shaming via social media can be an effective means to curb pollution where other enforcement efforts are ineffective.  If major polluters know they will be exposed in the media, hopefully they will take pollution seriously and take steps to avoid public shaming.

Following the roundtable discussion at the Ministry, Professor Pallant continued his three-country tour, flying to Vietnam where he will work with the YSEALI Streams of Hope team there.  From there he will go on to the Philippines to speak again about maintaining healthy waterways.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Cambodia is home to an amazingly diverse collection of animals.  One animal  the elephant  has long been part of Cambodian history.  Elephants have assisted human endeavors in various ways for centuries; from helping Cambodians sustain themselves through agriculture and forestry, to even taking Khmer warriors into battle.  If you have visited the Angkor Wat area, I am sure that you noticed the images of elephants carved on the walls of ancient Khmer temples.  Elephants can still be seen in Cambodia today carrying crops, lumber and just about anything else, including tourists.  Unfortunately, the number of elephants in Cambodia has decreased over the years due to illegal poaching and mistreatment.  I recently had the pleasure to learn more about these endangered animals at the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center during a visit with my Youth Council.

Today, I want to focus on a very special elephant named Sambo, one of Phnom Penhs most famous attractions.  For more than 30 years, Sambo spent nine or more hours a day carrying tourists around Wat Phnom.  Sambos work helped support her owner, Sin Sorn, and his family.  However, the numerous hours spent walking on the hard pavement of Phnom Penhs streets caused Sambo to develop chronic foot infections.  After her plight received worldwide attention in 2012, a nongovernmental organization was able to provide Sambo with the medical treatment she dearly needed.  

I was delighted to learn that Sambo is retiring to a special elephant sanctuary in Mondulkiri Province, where she will live with other elephants and receive proper veterinary care.  Sambos retirement and transportation to her new home is a wonderful example of what can be accomplished by working together.  This collaborative effort was supported by the U.S. government through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Cambodias Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Alexander Abraham Foundation, and private citizens.  A farewell ceremony was held in her honor in Phnom Penh last week and I was pleased to see a number of Cambodian and international media outlets covering the event.  Sambos story is truly uplifting and helps put the people of Cambodia in a positive light.

This week, I have been eagerly waiting for news about Sambos journey to her new home.  So I was delighted to hear that five days after leaving Phnom Penh, Sambo safely arrived at the Elephants Livelihood Initiative Environment project inside the Seima Protected Forest.  From the reports I received, she looks happy in her new home and will meet other elephants in the next few days.  I would like to thank everyone who made all of this possible; especially the people who cared for Sambo during the long journey to Mondulkiri. 

I believe that all animals deserve to be treated well.  As a reader, you know that I am an animal lover and my family has had a dog for nearly as long as I can remember.  By treating Sambo and other animals with respect and dignity, our society demonstrates compassion.  I commend Mr. Sorn for agreeing to let Sambo  now 52 years old  retire and spend the remaining years of her life in a natural habitat with other elephants.  As Mr. Sorn said, We owe Sambo a great debt and it is time to pay her back.  I couldnt agree more.

""As many of my readers may know, the U.S. Womens National Team recently won the 2015 FIFA Womens World Cup.  Americans all over the world are celebrating this electrifying victory by our national womens soccer team.  I am very proud of these young athletes, who have shown that anything is possible through hard-work and resolve.  Congratulations to all members of the U.S. Womens National Team!

As Nelson Mandela once said, Sport has the power to change the world.  Events like the FIFA Womens World Cup show us all that a universal passion for sports can transcend linguistic and sociocultural differences to bring people together.  Sports also play a role in shaping strong, inspiring individuals.  As the members of the U.S. Womens National Team have shown, participation in sports teaches leadership, teamwork, and communication skills that can help young people succeed in all areas of their lives.  It is great to know that this is also taking place in many forms here in Cambodia.""

-From the Ambassador's Penh

During my time as Ambassador, I have come to appreciate Cambodias unique cultural heritage  a source of tremendous pride and identity for the Cambodian people.  Like many of you, I am troubled by reports about priceless artifacts that have been stolen and trafficked.  However, I am encouraged that individuals, institutions, and governments are working in partnership to protect the rich cultural heritage of Cambodia and the proud history of the Khmer people.

This week, we witnessed a success story in the ongoing efforts to repatriate looted art to Cambodia.  During an official handover ceremony at the Council of Ministers building on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Sok An welcomed the return of Hanuman, a 10th century statue of the Hindu monkey god which was looted from Prasat Chen at Koh Ker during the turbulence of the Khmer Rouge era.  The Hanuman statue had been in the possession of the Cleveland Museum of Art since 1982.

Along with the Duryodhana, Bhima, and Balarama statues that were returned last year and the twin Pandava Kneeling Attendant statues that were returned in 2013, the Hanuman is the sixth statue from Prasat Chen that has returned to Cambodia.  I am pleased that these statues are back where they belong.

I would like to congratulate the Cleveland Museum of Art and its director, Dr. William Griswold, for their efforts to return the Hanuman statue after the museum uncovered information about the statues provenance.  The Cleveland Museum of Arts efforts reflect the highest ethical standards and demonstrate a true commitment to the preservation of Cambodias cultural heritage.  

I also applaud the Cleveland Museum of Art for signing a memorandum of understanding with the National Museum of Cambodia to collaborate on future projects.  This agreement between the two institutions is an excellent example of the strong bonds of friendship, cooperation, and respect between our two nations.  As Dr. Griswold said, We are very happy to provide assistance to the National Museum and to be working with our Cambodian colleagues from whom we are learning more and more about the art and culture of Cambodia.  We are very excited about the possibilities for increasing the American publics awareness of and appreciation for Khmer art through loans to our museum.

For many years, the U.S. Embassy has worked with Cambodia to help protect the Kingdoms unique historical and cultural heritage and to encourage others to do the same.  I believe this repatriation underscores the deepening relationship between our two countries.  I look forward to continuing this partnership to safeguard Cambodias cultural legacy for future generations.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Last week, I mentioned that many girls in Cambodia face numerous challenges to stay in school.  Girls in Cambodia also face obstacles that inhibit them from voicing their opinions and playing an active role in their communities.  Today, I want to highlight the efforts of our dedicated U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers who are making a difference in Cambodia.  Since 2006, more than 360 Peace Corps Volunteers have served in Cambodia.  As part of their various education and health projects, the Volunteers are also working with students, families, and the communities where they serve to empower young women and to find solutions that allow girls to stay in school.

When First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama visited Cambodia two weeks ago, she delivered a speech to the very first Let Girls Learn workshop for Peace Corps Volunteers and the local leaders, educators, and students they work with.  Mrs. Obama told the workshop participants youre the embodiment of what Let Girls Learn is all about.  Its really about Peace Corps Volunteers, community leaders, parents, and girls themselves working side-by-side to help girls go to school, and, more importantly, stay in school.  Eventually the Peace Corps will conduct these girls education workshops for all of its nearly 7,000 volunteers and tens of thousands of community leaders in the countries they work in.

In support of the Let Girls Learn initiative, Peace Corps is promoting and helping fundraising efforts for girls empowerment programs such as Camp GLOW (Girls Leading Our World).  These camps, held all across the world in every Peace Corps country, are designed to encourage young women to become active citizens by promoting gender equality, developing leadership skills, improving self-esteem, increasing knowledge of womens health issues, and supporting aspirations and career goals.  These camps offer adolescent girls self-development opportunities in a fun and friendly atmosphere and instill in each young woman the belief that she can make a difference in her community and country.

Here in Cambodia, more than 2,400 Cambodian students participated in GLOW camps and workshops conducted by Peace Corps Volunteers last year.  Just last weekend, eight Volunteers and their counterparts organized a three-day GLOW camp in Prey Veng for 64 girls from Prey Veng and Svay Rieng.  The camp provided a safe space where the girls could learn about general and reproductive health, the dangers of human trafficking, and about healthy relationships and domestic violence.  The girls also learned about resume writing, attending college, and applying for scholarships in a workshop designed help them prepare for future opportunities.  Another six camps will be held across Cambodia in May and June of this year. 

I want to thank all the Volunteers and their counterparts for working so hard to make the GLOW camps so successful.  It is truly inspiring to see how the camps have encouraged girls to discover their voices.  I know these efforts are having a tremendous impact from the testimony I hear from organizers and participants.  Kelly Confer, one of the Volunteers who helped organize the GLOW camp in Prey Veng, said the girls now have the knowledge and have been given the tools to continue their education.  Tara Kelly, a Volunteer in Kampong Cham said, I see incredible change from my young female students in just two years.  I see them thinking about their futures for the first time.  I see them standing up confidently in class.

More importantly, the young women that Tara mentors are transferring their passion to work towards change to other young women just like them.  Samanik, Taras host sister, attended the Let Girls Learn workshop in Siem Reap and contributed often during the group activities.  The remarks by Mrs. Obama have inspired Samanik to help her peers get an education.  She has many friends who have dropped out of school.  Now she is coming up with ideas to get her friends back in school and using social media to promote girls education.  Samanik is an example of how a personal relationship with a Peace Corps Volunteer can lead to big changes in one girl.  I truly believe these personal relationships the Volunteers have developed with their students and others in the community have helped change peoples minds about the importance of girls education.  I couldnt be more proud of Samanik, Tara, and everyone else making a difference in the lives of Cambodian girls. 

The First Lady told Samanik and the other Cambodian girls we need you to be the leaders of tomorrow.  Mrs. Obama added, When you have the chance to fulfill your potential, theres no limit to what you can achieve.  I couldnt agree more.  And thanks to the Peace Corps GLOW camps, girls are empowered to voice themselves and participate in their community and country.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

No matter where I travel in this country, every Cambodian I meet tells me how much they love their mobile phone!  Since I arrived nearly three years ago, I have watched with astonishment the dramatic growth in the use of mobile phones in Cambodia.  According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the number of mobile phone subscribers in Cambodia topped 20 million in 2013  which means there are five million more mobile phone subscriptions than there are people in Cambodia. 

The reach of mobile phones in Cambodia is hard to miss, with over 90 percent of the population having access.  Today, mobile phones play a big role in improving the lives of people by providing access to information in places where landlines or the Internet are not available.  The transformative effect that mobile phones are having on Cambodian society is evident in a number of examples.  More people are starting to access resources for English language education through their phones.  Farmers living in rural provinces today can now use a basic mobile phone to make calls and receive text messages about commodity prices on cassava or the latest market price of rice.  Students are using their smart phones to connect with others on the Internet and participate in online discussions.  For some Cambodians, accessing news and information via online media through the phone either compliments or replaces traditional media.  So as you can see, there is tremendous opportunity for mobile phone technology to enhance the lives of every Cambodian.   

The rise of mobile applications (apps) for smart phones allows people to shop, video chat, navigate streets, and much more.  Smart phone apps are designed to make our lives easier and more efficient.  With the trend of smart phones becoming more popular in Cambodia, the demand for quality application developers who know the local market is increasing as well.  Currently, there are very few apps developed for the Cambodian community.  Thats why members of my Embassy staff have spoken to information technology students at Cambodian universities and encouraged them to become part of the community of mobile application developers. 

Did you also know there is an app for teachers and students looking to build their English skills?  They can download the free American English Mobile App developed by the U.S. Department of State anytime, anywhere on their mobile phone.  The app works with almost any phone and users can download audiobooks, e-books, music, dictionary and translation tools, and much more.  In addition to this, we support the development of mobile apps through the USAID-funded Development Innovations program and its Social Innovation Lab, which helps promote the use of technology to meet Cambodias development challenges. 

Mobile phone technology can also help Cambodians deal with specific issues affecting them.  In the health sector, mobile technology helps key populations stay healthy and receive the treatment and care they need.  In this endeavor, the U.S. government has assisted in the development of an interactive voice response (IVR) system and smart phone apps to support HIV prevention and treatment, expanded the use of a mobile phone alert system that rapidly shares tuberculosis diagnoses via text messaging, and developed a mobile phone application to improve malaria prevention and treatment.  

Are you one of the many people in Cambodia who uses a mobile phone to access the Internet and social media platforms like Facebook?  If so, I encourage you to like the U.S. Embassys Facebook page if you are not already a fan.  There you will find all the most current information about the programs we offer. 

Do you have a mobile phone?  I am eager to hear how mobile technology has made an impact in your daily life.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I want to take this opportunity not only to wish a Happy Khmer New Year to all Cambodians, but share how we celebrated this important holiday at the U.S. Embassy last week.  As you can see in these photos, we had a wonderful time marking the arrival of the Year of the Goat!  Thanks to our Cambodian staff members who organized the annual New Year celebration for the community, we enjoyed traditional Khmer culture, games, food, and dance.  In particular, I want to recognize the commitment of our Local Employee Committee members who work diligently to help us maintain high employee morale year round.

The beauty of Cambodian culture was on full display with performances by the children from the National Action Culture for the Orphan Poor Children Association (NACOPCA), an NGO dedicated to providing poor and orphaned children with accommodation, food, and education while giving them an opportunity to learn traditional Cambodian dancing.  Following the traditional Blessing Dance was the Trot, a traditional dance based on two folktales, which showcases wild animals to ward off bad luck from the previous year and bring good luck and prosperity in the coming year.

Our celebration also included the folk dance Chhay Yam, which featured drummers and dancers wearing comic masks.  Chhay Yam is performed in the countryside and the cities on ceremonial occasions, such as the marking of the end of the monks rainy season retreat.  Next was an adaptation of the fairy tale Cinderella, which was presented by some of the Embassys Cambodian and American staff members.  This was followed by a fun fashion show of different forms of traditional Cambodian dress.  It was wonderful to see these colleagues share their enthusiasm and artistic talent with their co-workers.

The celebration would not have been complete without some fun and friendly competition.  One of my favorite traditional Khmer games is Bos Angkhun, which is played by throwing an inedible fruit seed (angkhun) at targets.  We also tested our physical strength in a game of tug-of-war, which is called Teanh Proatt in Khmer, and had fun racing one another in Leak Kanseng.  

 I am grateful for all of their outstanding accomplishments and hard work of our staff during the past year.  Without their talents and dedication, the U.S. Embassy would not be able to carry out its mission to engage with the Cambodian people in so many ways.  To all of my Cambodian readers, as you gather with your families and return to your home towns in the coming days, I would like to wish you a peaceful, prosperous, happy, and safe Khmer New Year.

Suor Sdey Chhnam Thmei!

We are deeply concerned by todays removal of Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Sam Rainsy from the National Assembly in a unilateral move by the ruling Cambodian Peoples Party.  We call on the National Assembly to reinstate him immediately and to restore his parliamentary immunity.  We also call on the government to revoke the arrest warrant issued against Rainsy on seven-year-old defamation charges and to allow him and other opposition Parliamentarians to return to Cambodia without fear of arrest or persecution.  

Todays actions are the latest incidents of harassment and intimidation of Cambodias opposition, including the recent violent attacks against two opposition Members of Parliament and the removal of opposition party deputy leader Kem Sokha from his position as First Vice President of the National Assembly.  These developments are harmful to Cambodian democracy and contrary to the wishes of the Cambodian people.

We urge the government to take immediate steps to guarantee a political space free from threats or intimidation in Cambodia, and for the government and opposition to engage in serious and meaningful dialogue on actions to strengthen Cambodias democratic future.

December 10, 2015 

Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."" - Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The United States stands with the people of #Cambodia and billions of others around the world in celebration of Human Rights Day. This years theme highlights four freedoms  freedom of speech, of religion, from want, and from fear  which underlie the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While there has been significant progress in advancing these and other fundamental freedoms in Cambodia, more needs to be done in order to safeguard these liberties for all citizens.
 
When reflecting on the true meaning of freedom  particularly the freedom of speech  I recall a famous quote: I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."" Freedom of expression is not only guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; it is also a vital element of the Constitution of the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia. Therefore, I encourage all Cambodians  members of the Royal Government, civil society, and everyday citizens  to work together to ensure that the countrys laws, the media, and the Internet are devices utilized to protect the freedom of expression.
 
The United States is deeply committed to the protection of the basic freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  As President Obama notes, Protecting human rights around the globe extends the promise of democracy and bolsters the values that serve as a basis for peace in our world.  As U.S. Ambassador to the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia, I am proud to support the Cambodian people as the country continues to develop a strong and enduring democracy that fully promotes and protects human rights.  The U.S. Embassy remains committed to our partnerships with all sectors of Cambodian society to promote freedom and democracy  not only on #HumanRightsDay, but every day.

Considered a masterpiece of New Khmer Architecture  a movement that unites modernist sensibilities with distinctly Cambodian traditions  the building is constructed with the help of U.S. assistance. Vann Molyvann helps usher in a golden age of Khmer culture, during which architecture, music, and film flourish until the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975.
 
1962: The International Court of Justice in The Hague rules in favor of Cambodia in a dispute with Thailand over Preah Vihear, an 11th century temple located in a disputed area near the Thai border. Former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson successfully represents Cambodia in the case, which many observers had predicted would see Thailand prevail. After the verdict, Prince Norodom Sihanouk proclaims a seven-day national holiday and the country erupts into mass celebrations.

1965: With the conflict escalating in Vietnam, border incursions into eastern Cambodia increase and result in civilian casualties. Prince Sihanouk fears for his countrys territorial integrity and seeks assurances from both the United States and communist governments. His political power is further threatened by dissident groups. Meanwhile, the United States claims that the Cambodian military is cooperating with Viet Cong forces. Unable to resolve their grievances, the United States and Cambodia officially sever diplomatic ties in May. Relations are not restored until the end of the decade.

1967: Jacqueline Kennedy visits Cambodia in November as a personal guest of Prince Sihanouk. A crowd of 10,000 greets her at Pochentong Airport in Phnom Penh, including girls strewing jasmine petals in a traditional Buddhist welcome. During her trip, the former First Lady fulfills a lifelong dream of visiting Angkor Wat. She is the first American to be received with high state honors since ties were broken, signaling a promising turn in the relationship.

1969: President Richard M. Nixon orders a covert bombing campaign of eastern Cambodia. Operation Menu lasts 14 months and results in the release of some 2,756,941 tons of ordnance. Nixon authorizes the bombings in an attempt to thwart Viet Cong forces, which by 1970 occupy between a fifth and a third of Cambodian territory. The campaign does not become known to the American public until 1973.

1969: Diplomatic relations are restored. The U.S. Embassy reopens on August 16, with Lloyd M. Rives acting as Charg dAffaires ad interim and a staff of eight. Later that month, in an effort to demonstrate Washingtons renewed commitment to Cambodia, U.S. Senator Mike Mansfield visits Phnom Penh for the third time in seven years. During the visit, Prince Sihanouk calls the Senator one of the greatest and most loyal friends to Cambodia.

Sotie and I were incredibly impressed by the mountaintop location and the excellent condition of many parts of the temple. It is a remarkable cultural asset that all Cambodians should be proud of. - #AmbHeidt 

The Ambassador and his wife Sotie visited the spectacular temples of Preah Vihear and Koh Ker on May 24. These temples are being preserved and protected by the Cambodian government thanks to the contributions of people like Dr. Kim Sedara, an alumnus of The Fulbright Program and Chairman of the National Authority of Preah Vihear (NAPV). The Ambassador met NAPV representatives, Member of Parliament H.E. Yara Suos, and officials from the Ministries of Interior, Culture and Fine Arts, and Tourism to discuss projects being implemented through partnerships like ICC-Preah Vihear. While there has been significant progress in protecting the temples, much work is still needed to ensure the full protection of these historic landmarks and to increase the number of people that can visit them. 

The temple sites of Preah Vihear and Koh Ker are two of the most remarkable examples of ancient Khmer architecture found in #Cambodia. Preah Vihear Temple is one of the two cultural sites in Cambodia listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List (the other is Angkor). The temple's history can be traced to the 9th century and due to its location atop a 525-meter cliff, the site has been very well preserved. Koh Ker is another remote temple location, about 2.5 hours from Siem Reap. More than 50 temples are currently open to visitors at the site, including the pyramid-shaped Prasat Thom and Prasat Chen.

Did you know that today is #WorldHepatitisDay? Viral hepatitis is the 7th leading cause of death in the world, with about 1.4 million people falling victim to the disease each year. Although treatments and vaccines exist, less than 5% of people with chronic hepatitis know they have it and less than 1% have access to treatment. Here in #Cambodia, one of the goals of the National Immunization Program (NIP) is to reduce Hepatitis-B prevalence to less than 1% by 2017. The NIP has made a significant impact on the reduction of hepatitis and other vaccine preventable diseases, contributing to important health gains across the country. 

Hepatitis-B immunization in Cambodia has increased dramatically since its introduction in 2001. The Ministry of Health is working with a number of local and international partners, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, CDC, and others to provide services and increase community awareness of - and demand for - immunization to combat hepatitis and other diseases.

On December 30, Ambassador Heidt and Minister of Education Hang Chuon Naron were on hand for a lecture at RUPP by world-famous scientist and entrepreneur Dr. Stephen Wolfram entitled The Future of Computation and Knowledge.  

Dr. Wolfram is the founder and CEO of software company Wolfram Research, based in the United States, and the creator of the Wolfram Language, which powers the free answer engine Wolfram Alpha.  The talk was organized by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports; the U.S. Embassy; the Cambodia Science & Engineering Festival; and the Cambodian Mathematical Society.

As Dr. Wolfram explained, unlike traditional search engines Wolfram Alpha doesnt search the web for answers; it answers factual questions by computing answers.  During the presentation, Dr. Wolfram demonstrated this by entering a series of mathematical and other questions, including How many chickens in Cambodia?.  Below is Wolfram Alphas answer to that question, based on the best available data.  This graph didnt exist before Dr. Wolfram asked the question.  Rather, Wolfram Alpha created it, using the information in its database.

In his introduction, Ambassador Heidt talked about the role of science, technology, and innovation in the American economy and challenged Cambodian youth to harness technology to build an innovation society.  You can read his remarks here: http://cambodia.usembassy.gov/123015_sp.html

As a reader of my blog, you know that I have written about the amazing work of civil society and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Cambodia.  I have no doubt that the advances that Cambodia has achieved in recent years  a growing economy, improvements in health care and schools, progress in human rights, and more  is due in great part to the work of NGOs.  Thats because NGOs often fill a pressing need where government funding for services is limited.  They also promote good governance, efficiency, and transparency  all critical elements of a healthy democracy.  I believe a strong, vibrant, and free civil society plays a vital role in addressing the future challenges facing Cambodia.  Thats why the United States is closely following the developments on the draft NGO law and other legislation, such as the cybercrime law and the pending trade union law, being considered by the Cambodian government.  As part of that effort, Scott Busby  Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) for the Department of States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  visited Cambodia this week to observe the current situation first-hand and obtain feedback on the draft laws. 

During his visit, DAS Busby met with representatives of civil society and the Royal Government of Cambodia to hear their thoughts on the draft laws.  Civil society representatives told him one of their chief concerns about the draft NGO law is they dont know what the law says.  Some of the NGOs have repeatedly called on the Cambodian government to share the draft law publicly and hold public forums so they can comment on it and offer their recommendations.  Other NGOs have expressed anxiety and concern because the law could impose restrictions or burdens that would make it difficult or even impossible for them to do their crucial work in Cambodia.  DAS Busby raised their concerns in a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hor Namhong.  One of the points DAS Busby made is the importance of sharing the draft NGO law with the public and civil society.  He also said the draft NGO law should be reviewed and subject to a robust debate.  When discussing the issue of Montagnard asylum seekers, DAS Busby urged the Foreign Minister to allow asylum seekers to register with the government and to have their claims to refugee status heard and adjudicated.

Before departing, DAS Busby held a press conference to reiterate the purpose of his visit to Cambodia.  In his remarks, he said, as the debate over the NGO law continues, it is important to realize that the world is watching.  The United States will continue to follow the developments on the draft NGO law closely because we believe any change in the law that restricts rather than empowers civil society does not serve the best interests of the Cambodian people.  When civil society is strong, the country is stronger, DAS Busby said.  I couldnt agree more.  Thats why the United States is committed to helping the Cambodian people, including civil society, build a stronger country.

What are your thoughts about the draft laws being considered by the Cambodian government?  I encourage you to voice your opinion.  A healthy dialogue is a key part of Cambodias democracy.

-The Ambassador's Penh

I would like to express my gratitude to the U.S. Embassys Marine Security Guard Detachment for planning the annual Marine Corps Ball last Saturday at the Sofitel Hotel in Phnom Penh.  It was an honor and a privilege to participate in such an amazing event in recognition of the Marines and to celebrate 239 years of distinguished service to our nation and to global peace and security.

This occasion was among a number of events taking place around the world to commemorate the founding of the Marine Corps on November 10, 1775.  Several distinguished guests were in attendance, including government officials, military service members, and representatives from various companies, non-governmental organizations, and diplomatic missions here in Cambodia.  I was delighted to see so many of my friends there; people who share my appreciation for the Marines serving here at the Embassy and for all Marines and members of the armed forces that serve across the globe.

The Marine Ball is a time-honored tradition complete with elegant tuxedos and evening gowns, inspiring speeches and presentations, and of course, dancing.  Another component of the Marine Ball is the cake cutting ceremony.  The first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine present, who then offers it to the youngest Marine in attendance.  This ritual symbolizes the older and wiser Marines passing their knowledge to the next generation.  I was also presented with a slice of cake from one of our Marines, and just like the entire Marine Ball, it was fantastic!

There are not enough words to express the depth of my respect and gratitude for the Marines.  Their hard work, dedication, and sacrifice inspire me and countless others.  After 239 years of service, the Marine Corps motto of Semper Fidelis  always faithful  is as true today as it was in 1775.  They continue to defend our nation, our citizens, and our values with honor, dignity, and excellence.

DAY 10
""I feel like time was crawling for the first few days then it started moving in a running speed. As I reflect back on each and every moment I spent on the train, the journey is absolutely a life-changing and eye-opening experience for me. In spite of how much I love traveling, I had not experience such crazy amazing trip before...You have to be flexible and adapt to changes and the environment you live in. One of my favorite quotes by James P. Lewis is ""If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you always got."" The 10-day train journey have given me so much more than what I expected: Friendship, support, inspiration from the fellow participants, mentors, speakers and staffs, the true experience with American culture and people, witnessing the beautiful landscape across America from Los Angeles to Washington DC from the train, and the moments everyone is so open to each other sharing their personal stories and experience. I truly feel inspired and privileged. I am so grateful to be part of this journey. Now it's time to put together what I have learned and accomplished during the journey to make a social impact on the community I'm living in and the community I left.""

1950: The United States establishes diplomatic relations with Cambodia on June 29, with the appointment of Donald R. Heath as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. The U.S. Legation opens in Phnom Penh on November 14 at the renowned Hotel Le Royal.  A Legation office and U.S. Information Service library are later established at a new location. The Legation is raised to Embassy status on June 25, 1952, at which point Heath becomes the first U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia.



1953: Cambodia declares its full independence from France on November 9, after intense negotiations between King Norodom Sihanouk and the French governmentwith the United States often acting as mediator. Throughout the talks, the United States actively supports Cambodias bid for autonomy, although France does not fully cede authority over Cambodia until the Geneva Conference in 1954.



1955: The United States establishes an assistance program in Cambodia with a budget of $50 million per year. The aid seeks to promote Cambodias economic and social progress by improving and expanding public education, building infrastructure, and modernizing the armed forces among other activities. The aid program is larger in size and scope than the combined support from all other countries and international organizations, with the United States providing $493 million in assistance by 1963.



1958: Sihanouk, who abdicated the throne in 1955 and took the title of Prince, becomes the first Cambodian head of state to visit the United States. His itinerary includes stops in Washington, D.C., New York City, Detroit, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The Princes visit causes a stir in diplomatic circles, particularly following the Cambodian-themed parties he organizes in New York and Washington that include a traditional Khmer dance recital by the Royal Cambodian Ballet. During talks with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Prince presents a 12th-century solid granite Angkorian Buddha that still stands today in Washingtons National Gallery.


1959: Cambodia unveils National Highway Four, built with $25 million of U.S. assistance. The 140-mile road, which links Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville, is dubbed the Khmer-American Friendship Highway. Built by American and Cambodian laborers working side by side, the road is the single largest cooperative aid project in Cambodia. U.S. development assistance also helps repair a further 800 miles of road and 43 bridges throughout the country.",2010-08-02,1.0

Want to get ahead as a leader?  SEAYLP is a great place to start for young people who want to make a difference.

SEAYLP brings together high school students and adult mentors from the ten ASEAN member countries for an exchange program in the United States focused on empowering youth and promoting leadership skills.  SEAYLP members engage in activities on civic education, leadership, diversity, and volunteerism, which will prepare them to conduct projects to serve their communities.

Each year the application process is opened to youth in a different region of Cambodia.  This year, students and educators from Ratanakiri Province are invited to apply.  The deadline to apply is November 25, 2014.

SEAYLP alum An I Younan recalls fond memories of his time in the program.  As he said:

""SEAYLP is the best exchange program of them all.  One thing about it is you make a lot of friends that will probably last for the rest of your life.  We all had fun learning leadership skills, things about the environment and how to enjoy American culture.  I remember the day we had a global youth leadership camp, we got along so close and enjoyed the diversity of different culture while we shared stories with each other.  As you see in the photo it was our farewell and everyone's heart dropped because we knew that we would say goodbye to around sixty of the most amazing people we had ever met.""

Today the U.S. National Park Service celebrates its 100th anniversary! Signed into law on August 25, 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson, the National Park Service was created to preserve and protect federally-owned parks and other properties. The National Park Service manages more than 400 protected areas, including monuments, battlefields, seashores, and even the White House. 

The National Park Service is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, which is responsible for the management and conservation of federal land and natural resources.  Representatives from the U.S. Department of the Interior were in #Cambodia this week to discuss ways to prevent wildlife trafficking.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Business is booming in Cambodia.  Every day I see signs of this:  tall buildings are changing the Phnom Penh skyline; more franchises especially American onesare opening retail stores or restaurants; and Phnom Penh now features the major Asian mall brand AEON.  This is just the street view of the economy.  Looking at the bigger picture, Cambodias economy is predicted to grow seven percent in 2015 and bilateral trade between Cambodia and the United States continues to increase every year.

I applaud the government of Cambodia for creating an increasingly pro-business atmosphere.  But with 70 percent of the Cambodian population under the age of 30 and given that an estimated 300,000 young Cambodians enter the job market every year, teaching entrepreneurship to youth is essential for their career options and the countrys economic growth.  I believe Cambodia needs more young entrepreneurs  those innovative and creative business people  who identify a need and work to build a business to meet that need. 

Earlier this week, the U.S. Embassy hosted a live video conference on entrepreneurship with Evan Burfield of startup incubator 1776 and members of the Cambodian YSEALI community.  As you may know, the Young Southeast Asia Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), launched by President Obama in 2013, is a group of bright young leaders working to improve their communities by working locally and globally.  YSEALI members are the type of self-starters that would especially benefit from interacting with a successful entrepreneur like Burfield.  The video conference was an opportunity for these young Cambodians to learn from and ask questions about what it takes to become an entrepreneur.  They discussed everything from the importance of persevering after failing to the value of higher education. 

Before the video conference, I opened the floor for discussion.  After several questions, what became evident to me was the need for more business role models and mentors in Cambodia.  Fortunately, groups like the Cambodian Young Entrepreneurs Association, Cambodia Women Entrepreneurs Association, the American Chambers of Commerce (AmCham), Junior Chamber International, and other business groups serve this role by offering support to young entrepreneurs and start-up businesses.  Below, you will find links to these groups websites.  If you want to start up your own business, if you are trying to launch the next great idea, if you are an entrepreneur, please contact these organizations and ask for their help.  The entrepreneurial world is built on people helping each other. 

The YSEALI members who participated in this video conference displayed the smart, capable, and eager traits I have come to associate with the entrepreneurial spirit.  We are always looking for more young Cambodians to join YSEALI.  If you are interested and are between 18-35 years old, please visit https://youngsoutheastasianleaders.state.gov/ and join.

Have you ever had an idea that you wanted to turn into action? Is your group or organization passionate about saving the environment? 
 
A call for grant proposals on the topic of environmental advocacy has been issued by the Office of Public Diplomacy at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  Grant proposals of up to $250,000 are welcome from U.S. and local non-profit organizations, academic institutions, international  groups and those alike, to develop and manage a four-day workshop on the theme of environment as part of President Obamas Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI).  

The workshop will be entitled YSEALI Generation: Environmental Advocacy, Responsibility, and Teamwork, and will be held in Cambodia in April 2015.  Complete proposals must be submitted by email to uya@state.gov on or before December 15, 2014.

YSEALI was announced by President Obama in December 2013 and formally launched in May 2014.  The initiative aims to bring together young Southeast Asian leaders to help them work across ASEAN borders to solve common issues including economic development, education, environmental protection, and civic engagement.  Previous YSEALI Generation workshops have been held in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, and Rangoon, and the next one will be held in Singapore in early December on the theme of power of human capital.  The YSEALI Generation: Environmental Advocacy, Responsibility, and Teamwork workshop offers a way for young leaders to partner with the United States on addressing environmental issues, which also have a direct impact on economic development and other pressing concerns.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

To continue our series highlighting individuals and organizations with a focus on assisting women and girls in Cambodia, I would like to tell you about my latest visit to a place that is near and dear to my heart.  It is a place that takes in girls and young women who would not otherwise be able to attend school, providing them with an education and skills that prepare them for life well beyond graduation.  

The Don Bosco Foundation of Cambodia has offered training to disadvantaged and orphaned children since 1991.  Run by the Salesian sisters of the Catholic Church in Cambodia, the Don Bosco Childrens Fund has helped more than 50,000 Cambodian children get a basic education and have trained 10,000 young Cambodians through one of their six technical and vocational schools.  The U.S. Embassy strongly supports the mission of Don Bosco and other organizations dedicated to improving the lives of all Cambodians, but particularly those that place a special focus on empowering women and girls.

Earlier this week, I had the honor to visit the Don Bosco campus in the Phnom Penh neighborhood of Teuk Thla.  I have been to Don Bosco schools before, and with each visit I am moved by the work being done by the Salesian sisters.  They are dedicated to helping disadvantaged girls and young women, giving them a strong education, a sense of self-worth, and vocational skills they can use to become productive members of society and future leaders of Cambodia.

But on this most recent visit, I brought a special gift with me:  live music.  As part of the Embassys continued support of the children at Don Bosco and throughout Cambodia, we organized a concert of American music played by a fantastic group of musicians called the Trio Chicago & Friends.  Serving as cultural ambassadors, this group uses music to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the United States and other countries around the world.  The music was fantastic, the children were delightful, and everyone had a wonderful time.  I could not help but smile at the pure joy displayed by the students as they danced and clapped along with the music written by American composers such as George Gershwin, Duke Ellington, Leonard Bernstein, Irving Berlin, and so many more.  It was an impressive audience, with over 600 Don Bosco students and their teachers in attendance.  

The Don Bosco Foundation shares many of the same goals that we do, which is why the Embassy provides assistance to the organization.  Funding not only delivers vocational training and skills; it also helps girls learn to make good choices in life and play more active roles in their communities.  Thanks to this program, girls from Don Bosco will be better prepared to compete  both in school and the job market  and become productive, engaged citizens.

The music from Trio Chicago and Friends was a fun break for the students.  After the performance, they returned to their classes and training.  They are well aware of the hard work ahead of them, as there are many obstacles to success.  However, being a girl or woman should not be one of those obstacles.  Today, graduates of Don Bosco  both boys and girls  have opportunities available to them in Cambodia that their predecessors did not have.  I encourage each of them and all of the young people around the country to work hard to fully achieve your potential.  

When you meet the girls at Don Bosco, it is easy to see why I have so much hope for the future of Cambodia.  These young women work hard and deserve the same opportunities as boys to accomplish whatever they want in life, no matter their backgrounds or hardships.  The U.S. Embassy strongly supports the mission of Don Bosco and the many other organizations that are dedicated to improving the lives of Cambodian girls.

As always, I look forward to receiving your comments and questions.

2003: The United States and Cambodia sign an agreement to restrict the import of Cambodian artifacts into the U.S.  market, in an attempt to prevent looting of Cambodias cultural heritage. A highlight of the deal is the repatriation in 2007 of a sandstone Apsara dancer from the 13th Century that had been smuggled into the United States. U.S. assistance also helps restore some of Cambodias most precious Angkorean monuments, including an ambitious $1.5 million project to preserve Phnom Bakheng temple.

2006: Former President Bill Clinton visits Cambodia in December. During a meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen, he signs a memorandum of understanding under which his Clinton Foundation will provide support in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, bilateral U.S. assistance makes a major impact on HIV/AIDS over the course of the decade, helping to cut the diseases prevalence rate from 2% to less than 1%, making Cambodia a rare success story in the global fight against the disease.

2006: The United States opens a new Embassy in January. The facility, which is located next to the famed Wat Phnom temple on Phnom Penhs north side, occupies an entire city block and houses over 500 employees. As the first purpose-built U.S. Embassy in Cambodia, the new complex is a sign of growing U.S. engagement in the country.

2007: On April 4, the Peace Corps swears in its first class of volunteers to serve in Cambodia. The 29 volunteers serve their two-year tours living with Cambodian families in rural villages throughout the country, teaching English at upper secondary schools and regional teacher training centers. Successive classes swell in size as the decade continues.

2009: The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, better known as the Khmer Rouge tribunal, begins its first case on February 16. The defendant is Kaing Guek Eav, better known by his revolutionary name Duch, who oversaw the torture and execution of some 12,000 people as warden of Tuol Sleng prison. After 30 years of waiting, Cambodian witnesses finally appear in a court of law to describe the horrors they endured under the Democratic Kampuchea regime. A verdict in Duchs case is expected in the summer of 2010. Meanwhile, the four remaining Khmer Rouge leaders in custody are likely to face trial in 2011. The United States has committed $6.8 million to support the trial.",2009-06-15,3.0

The first stop on my trip was at the University of South-East Asia (USEA) in Siem Reap, home to one of four American Corners in Cambodia.  After being greeted by Mr. Sien Sovanna, the founder and president of USEA, he and his staff led me on a tour of the school and the American Corner.  There, I observed and spoke with many students who were engaged in a number of exciting and interactive English-based learning activities.  As I walked around and listened to students, I was impressed by the level of English that they already possessed.  After the tour, I spoke with approximately 200 university and high school students about topics of interest to Cambodian youth, with most of our discussion focusing on English language learning, studying in the United States, the use of social media, and the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI).  I was happy to respond to their questions and encouraged by their desire to become YSEALI members.  

The next day, I visited the town of An Long Veng in Oddar Meanchey Province.  Researchers in the area have encountered a dangerous, drug-resistant form of malaria that threatens the years of progress the world has made in the fight against the disease.  With assistance from the United States, the Anlong Veng Referral Hospital and Health Center provides treatment and other services to approximately 25,000 people in 37 villages.  Since 2006, the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences and the Naval Medical Research Unit 2 has conducted studies in Oddar Meanchey.  With support from the Presidents Malaria Initiative, they have been leading U.S. government efforts in the fight against drug-resistant malaria in Cambodia.  The lab technicians and hospital staff members were very helpful in helping me understand their work.  I was humbled to learn how our support is saving and improving lives. 

Later that afternoon, I participated in activities for Malaria Week, which takes place every year before the rainy season, when the incidence of malaria rises.  Malaria Week is a time to increase awareness and prevention of malaria infections through testing and treatment in the community.  Activities include health education through popular Khmer video shows as well as distribution of mosquito nets to villagers who otherwise might not be able to afford these simple yet lifesaving tools.  I met with the Chief of Party for Control and Prevention of Malaria (CAP-Malaria) Dr. Khieng Soy Ty and other local leaders.  Sponsored by USAID, CAP-Malaria works closely with the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control, the Provincial Health Department, the An Long Veng health center, health workers, and local authorities to conduct this event.  More than 250 villagers joined the event to learn about getting tested and treated for malaria.  Some families received new or retreated mosquito nets as well, and I was very proud to assist with this effort.  

Returning to Siem Reap province the next day, I visited Wat Thmey to see a USAID-supported HIV/AIDS community-based care site managed by Salvation Centre Cambodia, a local Cambodian NGO.  I had the opportunity to talk with many individuals about how the program has changed their lives.  We care deeply about the effects of this disease on the people in need, which is why the U.S. government supports this project that provides a wide range of services to people living with and affected by this disease.  It is also a remarkable example of the progress that has been made in Cambodia to eliminate HIV/AIDS.  Currently, more than 70 percent of HIV-infected individuals in Cambodia are receiving care.  The United States serves as a proud partner with Cambodia in helping it obtain an AIDS-free generation. 

The U.S. government is also helping Cambodians to not only protect their forests and trees, but also benefit from them in a way that keeps the forests alive and growing.  Visiting the Chan Sar Cheung Community Forestry in Siem Reap  supported through USAID Cambodias Feed the Future program known as Helping Address Rural Vulnerability and Ecosystem Stability  I met with community members who have recently received training on ways they can make a living while protecting the forests  what the experts call sustainable forest management practices.  These forests are critical because they affect the water, the food supply, and a lot more in between.  Additionally, forests are key part of the climate change equation.  If they are destroyed, it would have devastating effects on the global climate and, of course, our lives.  I was able to speak with many people about how their livelihoods and their communities are getting better  all without destroying the forests.   

On my final stop for this trip, I visited the Rice Field Fisheries Enhancement Project, which seeks to improve sustainable rice field and fishery management practices in Cambodia.  In April 2012, USAIDs Feed the Future initiative awarded a four-year grant to WorldFish Center, an NGO with a mission to harness the potential of fisheries and aquaculture to reduce poverty and hunger.  I was very impressed with one of the communities that I visited, where people were raising fish in their rice fields!  This kind of ingenuity is something that I have always been impressed with when I visit the people of this great country. 

Whether we are challenged by limited access to education, the spread of disease, threats from climate change, or by the pains of hunger, I was reminded on this trip that if we work together, we can overcome some of the biggest challenges that the people of Cambodia are facing today.  It was a perfect example of the efforts that the U.S. government supports.  Its innovative, its cost-effective, and its the right thing to doeverything we look for in a solution that benefits all Cambodians.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I was reminded of Cambodias stunning natural beauty during a recent visit to the Preak Toal village and its neighboring bird sanctuary.  Located not far from Siem Reap, it is a breathtaking ecosystem full of plant and animal life.  Even getting to the sanctuary was an adventure; a two-hour boat ride through lush mangroves and wet forests.  But as visually impressive as the sanctuary was, I was most inspired by the people I met in the fishing communities of Preak Toal.  Their story is closely tied to the bird sanctuary and the remarkable Tonle Sap Lake. 

The people that live along the Tonle Sap are hard workers.  They depend on fish for food as well as their livelihoods, but this precious resource is not always available.  Changes in the weather, rains, and droughts can make fishing a difficult and frustrating activity.  As a fisherman myself, I know how patient and how attentive one has to be to land a catch.  Hearing about the daily challenges they face and knowing there are no easy solutions gave me a glimpse into how tough it can be to live and work in Preak Toal.

But as I listened to their stories, the issue they raised again and again was their childrens education.  Among the 3,500 youth under 18 years of age in Preak Toal, only 100 of them are in primary school and just 10 are in secondary school.  As a father, educating my children has been one of the top priorities of my life.  So I understand why the parents in this community are so worried about schooling.  Education is a tool that all children need to stand on their own and provide opportunities to their children in the future.

After talking with the fishermen, I visited the bird breeding sanctuary of the Preak Toal Core Area, part of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve and a breeding sanctuary for more than 100,000 large water birds from 12 different species.  With changes in climate and the natural environment, local wildlife species  many of them quite rare  have struggled to survive.  They have been losing their natural habitat at a rapid rate causing their populations to dwindle.  This was why I was so pleased to see that the fishing communities of Preak Toal have been deeply involved in the protection and management of the bird sanctuary that borders their homes.  With assistance from the U.S. government, members of the fishing villages have been trained to serve as forest rangers, monitoring and reporting on the bird populations of the sanctuary.  

The rangers position themselves on hand-built platforms perched high in the trees overlooking the sanctuary.  They can remain at their stations for up to 10 days at a time, closely watching the various birds residing in the area.  The hard work of these rangers  as well as the joint efforts of local Cambodian authorities and the U.S. Embassy  has led to significant increases in the bird population.  This precious ecosystem is gradually regaining its glory as the keeper of the regions huge number of animal and plant species.  

It was an incredible trip and an experience that I will never forget.  Speaking with the families of Preak Toal and seeing the beautiful bird sanctuary highlighted, once again, how important it is that Cambodians protect their precious resources.  I want to thank all those with whom I met for taking their time to share their story with me.  I was both moved and energized by their commitment to their community and their environment.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Americans love going to the movies. Catching the latest blockbuster on the big screen with friends on a Friday night is a rite of passage for many teenagers in America. Around the world, movies bring people together, they entertain us, and some even make us laugh or cry. I also believe films can teach us about our society, both past and present, and become an important part of our historical memory.

I know movies also appeal to Cambodians, especially young people. This country has a proud history of filmmaking. During the golden age of Cambodian cinema in the 1960s, over 300 films were made in the Kingdom. Sadly, only 30 of them survived the Khmer Rouge period. But I am optimistic about the future of Cambodian cinema. Today, a new generation of Cambodian filmmakers is receiving well-deserved recognition for their tireless work. Earlier this year, Rithy Panhs The Missing Picture was the first Cambodian film to be nominated for an Academy Award. In October, film director Sotho Kulikar received the Spirit of Asia Award at the prestigious Tokyo International Film Festival for her entry The Last Reel, which opened the 5th Annual Cambodia International Film Festival last week.

The Last Reel is the first full-length independent film by Hanuman Films, a Cambodian film production company run by Kulikar. Joining the film as executive producer was American Lloyd Levin, who first came to Cambodia to work on the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider film. At Hanuman Films, they are working to raise Cambodias profile by bringing more international film productions to the country.

I think movies can give a voice to the past, and this is true for The Last Reel, which explores the legacy of civil war and the shadow it has cast over the next generation. Kulikar hopes her film will play its part in a long overdue healing process in Cambodia, by encouraging generations old and young to talk more openly about the past.

I was also delighted to learn that the film Dont Think Ive Forgotten: Cambodias Lost Rock and Roll was featured during the Cambodia International Film Festival. John Pirozzi, the films American director, attended a special screening at Chaktomuk Theater and hosted a lively Q&A session with the musicians and performers from the film. As you may recall from a previous blog, Remembering Cambodias Lost Rock and Roll, this film is about Cambodias vibrant and unique music scene during the 1960s. The U.S. Embassy was honored to collaborate with John and the Documentation Center of Cambodia to support the world premiere of the film earlier this year. The film will premiere in the United States at the renowned Film Forum in New York City in April 2015, giving more people the chance to learn about Cambodias remarkable history and culture.

I am thrilled that so many people attended the Cambodia International Film Festival this year. Congratulations to all of the organizers and to the filmmakers who participated.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I am sure that most of my readers know that the First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama visited Cambodia last weekend.  Mrs. Obama was in Siem Reap province to introduce Let Girls Learn, a U.S. government initiative to raise awareness of access inequalities and breaking down barriers that block more than 62 million girls around the world from attending school.  The initiative, led by Peace Corps and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), will work with the Ministry of Education and local communities in Cambodia to find solutions to the challenges that prevent girls from staying in school.

However, government programs alone may not meet the immediate challenge of ensuring every girl has access to education  individuals and civil society organizations are also critical partners that work to help girls stay in school.  Room to Read, a U.S.-based organization, is one such partner working in 10 countries in Asia and Africa.  The organization, founded in 2000 on the motto World Change Starts with Educated Children, aims to transform the lives of millions of children by focusing on literacy and gender equality in education.  By working in collaboration with families, local communities, partner organizations, and governments, Room to Read has impacted the lives of more than nine million children around the world.

Room to Read has two programs to improve childrens education  the Literacy Program enables children to develop a regular habit of reading and the Girls Education Program supports girls in completing secondary school and developing life skills.  Here in Cambodia, I believe the success of Room to Read speaks for itself.  Since 2003, the organization has established 1,737 school libraries by providing materials and training for staff, helped fund construction of 253 schools, delivered reading and writing instruction workshops in 212 schools, and published over 180 books with nearly 1.4 million copies in circulation.  

Girls in Cambodia face many challenges to stay in school.  Some families are unable to afford to send their daughters to school or they place less value on girls education than on that of boys.  Room to Read tackles the issue of girls dropping out of school in a number of ways.  First, the Girls Education program provides six-year scholarships to girls whose families cannot support their study beyond the lower secondary level.  The support includes tutoring, school uniforms, learning materials, and mentoring.  Second, community meetings are held for parents to discuss their challenges and the importance of sending all of their childrennot just the boysto school.  The program also enlists volunteers in the local community to follow up on the girls academic performance and attendance, provide life skills trainings, and mentor the girls.  Lastly, Room to Read has established itself as a key partner for the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports to promote and strengthen the quality of education in Cambodia.

I am very proud that the First Lady chose to visit Room to Reads Girls Education Program in Cambodia to see first-hand how its community-driven solutions are changing girls lives.  Mrs. Obama was joined by Mrs. Bun Rany, First Lady of Cambodia, for a visit to the Hun Sen Bakorng High School in Siem Reap.  The first ladies met with 10 girls in the Girls Education Program who shared their personal stories of overcoming obstacles to education and to hear how they benefit from community-led programs like Room to Read.  

The U.S. government is committed to working with all stakeholders to improve girls access to education.  I applaud Room to Read for working with families, communities, and the Cambodian government to find local solutions to overcome the obstacles that prevent girls from staying in school.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

As you know, I pay special attention to the issue of landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), because I believe we need to protect innocent lives and make Cambodia a safer place.  Unfortunately, these explosive remnants of war kill and injure scores of Cambodians every year.  This is why the United States has provided more than $61 million over the past 20 years to support various demining organizations in their efforts to eradicate Cambodia of mines and UXOs. 

Recently, Deputy Assistant Secretary Rear Admiral Samuel Perez from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs visited Cambodia to see demining and UXO clearance operations first-hand.  He joined Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung and met with the Hazardous Areas Life-Support Organization (HALO) Trust, one of the demining organizations the U.S. government supports in Cambodia, to tour minefield clearance operations along the Thai-Cambodian border.

The staff at HALO Trust demonstrated the techniques they use to locate landmines and UXO and to safely remove them from the ground.  This intensive process requires highly trained staff, specific tools, and a lot of time and resources.  I admire these brave professionals for accepting the inherent risks associated with searching for and neutralizing explosive remnants of war, which helps ensure a safe environment for Cambodians.

The good news is that the number of casualties  both killed and wounded from landmines and UXO in Cambodia has dramatically declined since our efforts began.  We can all take heart in this tremendous progress to reduce the number of casualties, but there is much work left to be done before we can achieve the Royal Governments vision to make Cambodia mine impact-free by 2020.

The United States is committed to helping Cambodia achieve this goal.  I look forward to continuing this cooperation with the Cambodian government and our partners to eradicate mines and UXOs to make Cambodia a safer place for all.

by Ambassador William Todd 

George W. Bush signed into law the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR. PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a disease internationally, with more than $52 billion committed to fight HIV/AIDS (and malaria and tuberculosis) as of the end of 2013. This commitment to fight AIDS worldwide has been continued by President Obama. Through PEPFAR and other initiatives, the United States has rallied the world in the fight against HIV and AIDS.

But the United States is far from the only nation that is taking on HIV/AIDS. In fact, one of the world leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS is Cambodia. This is not just my own observation but the opinion of global experts. In 2010, the United Nations recognized Cambodia with a Millennium Development Goal Award for outstanding national leadership, commitment and progress for reducing HIV prevalence by more than 50% and for achieving universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment. In 2013, an expert panel reviewed Cambodias strategy for HIV and concluded that the country is on track to eliminate all new HIV infections by 2020. That would make Cambodia the first country in the world to achieve an AIDS-free generation!

The U.S. Government is proud to partner with Cambodia in its efforts to eliminate HIV/AIDS. The U.S. Embassy has had its own PEPFAR office since 2006, drawing on the resources of two outstanding agencies: the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In fact, some of our CDC staff are co-located with the Ministry of Health, working side by side on many health initiatives.

PEPFARs efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in Cambodia take many forms. One priority is to help to prevent new infections, with a particular focus on reducing the transmission between mothers and babies and among populations that are at highest risk of infection. PEPFAR programs have helped to care for individuals who are HIV-positive and for the orphans left behind by those who have died as a result of AIDS. PEPFAR also helps to ensure that HIV-positive Cambodians receive high-quality treatment and works to strengthen the Cambodian health system to ensure that it has the capacity and know-how to address the needs of HIV/AIDS patients.

During the last year, PEPFAR helped Cambodia provide treatment to almost 50,000 individuals and directly provided HIV testing to over 80,000 pregnant women. PEPFARs integrated approach to reducing AIDS in Cambodia is a model that should be duplicated in as many places as possible.

People often ask me if it is really possible that Cambodia could become the first country to have an AIDS-free generation, even before the United States. And my answer is yes  as long as Cambodia maintains its commitment.

Despite limited resources, Cambodia has worked strategically to address the problem of HIV/AIDS ever since the first cases were detected in the early 1990s. Cambodia is one of only 12 countries worldwide that has been able to ensure universal access to HIV treatment (according to the World Health Organization Global Update on Treatment, 2013). In addition, the Cambodian government has developed excellent cooperation with international, NGO, and civil society partners on the issue of HIV/AIDS. I congratulate the Ministry of Health and the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) for their leadership on this issue.

Although progress is being made, the fight to defeat HIV/AIDS in Cambodia is far from over. An estimated 75,000 adults and children are living with HIV in Cambodia, and there are approximately 1,100 new infections every year. Many people are still highly susceptible to HIV infection, including women and men who work in the sex industry and drug abusers. In addition, there is still discrimination against those who are living with HIV/AIDS, and even the threat of discrimination may prevent some people from getting the treatment that they need.

HIV/AIDS is not a problem that can be solved by governments alone  it is the responsibility of each and every one of us. On an individual level, we need to make smart choices and to protect ourselves and our loved ones. At the community level, we need to embrace those who are struggling with HIV/AIDS and ensure that they have access to the care and treatment that they need. And at the national and international level we need to continue to work together through programs like PEPFAR to bring resources where they are needed most.

What role will you play in helping Cambodia to have the worlds first AIDS-free generation?

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Cambodias economy is experiencing an entrepreneurial boom, as more people establish new and exciting businesses throughout the country.  Their work is a constant example of drive and innovation that can only strengthen Cambodias long-term economic prosperity.  Entrepreneurs are vital to igniting innovation, creating jobs, and promoting business-friendly policies that attract the interest of consumers and investors, both domestic and foreign.  The increasing number of entrepreneurs in Cambodia is a sure sign that the country is open for business. 

I am happy to learn that online businesses are also a part of this emerging trend of entrepreneurship in Cambodia.  One of these exciting new ventures is Worldbridge International and ACLEDA Banks My All In One Mall, or MAIO Mall.  With 70 companies on board, MAIO Mall gives consumers the ability to purchase products without worrying about time or distance, all while helping to develop Cambodians expertise and comfort with utilizing technology in innovative ways.  

MAIO Mall is a great example of e-commerce, a term for any type of business using the Internet to exchange goods and services.  In the United States, e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay have simplified Americans way of life by letting consumers purchase products online.  And yet, e-commerce doesnt only have benefits for consumers.  It also increases business opportunities, encourages healthy business competition, and leads to a stronger economy.  In Cambodia, online businesses and marketplaces like Kaymu and SnappyShop are already showing how budding entrepreneurs can now enter the market by using a low-cost and user-friendly platform to connect with potential consumers.   

Companies like MAIO Mall are developing business models to better understand and provide what Cambodian consumers want  from faster delivery of goods and services, to systems that allow them to purchase items using multiple forms of payment.  The arrival of e-commerce in the market is one more development in Cambodias economic evolution.  In fact, there are already many prominent Cambodian businesses using Facebook and other mobile applications to serve their customers.  Regardless of the size of the business, the success of online ventures benefits Cambodias economy and its people. 

However, creating a strong e-commerce sector does not happen overnight.  E-commerce requires a pro-business environment that protects intellectual property and consumer rights, which makes it easier to facilitate the payment and delivery of products.  The Cambodian government, which already has one of the most pro-business regulatory frameworks in the region, is currently working on legislation to support and regulate e-commerce.  Effective government policies could lead to partnerships with international companies such as PayPal, providing consumers with safe mechanisms to pay for products online and allowing businesses to earn both the trust and the capital they need to expand their ventures. 

With the increased presence of entrepreneurs in Cambodia, e-commerce can also be a vehicle for economic empowerment, particularly among women.  Recognizing the importance of women entrepreneurs in promoting economic growth, the United States  in collaboration with the Ministry of Womens Affairs and the Lower Mekong Initiatives StartUp Cup  will soon open the Womens Entrepreneurial Center of Resources, Education, Access and Training for Economic Empowerment (WECREATE) in Phnom Penh.  This center will help women start businesses and build the capacity of women-led enterprises through workshops, networking opportunities, and skills training sessions at a safe and centralized location.  A number of women entrepreneurs will be interested in developing e-commerce businesses, which can only lead to a more collaborative, impactful, and expansive business landscape in Cambodia.

I am excited to see how e-commerce continues to develop.  And with the ingenuity and talent of the countrys young entrepreneurs, I am confident that e-commerce will be a successful part of Cambodias economy.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY KERRY: International Day of Democracy

There are few ideas more powerful  more infused with universal aspiration  than democracy. 

The desire for democracy is shared by people the world over.  The privilege to vote, the freedom to speak your mind, the right to a government by the people and for the people, these are ideas that continue to inspire  from the Egyptians who took to Tahrir Square, to democracy activists in Burma, to the brave Ukrainians who took to the ballot box earlier this year. 

Today we recognize International Day of Democracy, a day set aside to a way of life that allows each and every citizen to participate in his or her government.  This years theme  Engaging Young People on Democracy  powerfully underscores the importance of youth in building and preserving democracy. 

Democratic societies are strong societies, because people are free to speak out against injustices and to discuss, debate, and work together to drive positive change  even with those who hold opposing views.  In a democracy, we are free to choose our leaders, hold government institutions accountable, and work with those institutions to build a more stable and prosperous future for all members of our society.  

As the United States works to strengthen our democracy at home, we will continue to support those around the world fighting for their voices to be heard.

Today marks the 66th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948, which affirms that the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.  The shared values that guided the international community in creating this landmark document in the wake of the Second World War  fundamental beliefs about liberty, equality, and justice under the law for all  remain essential today.  On this day, we recognize the progress that has been made in protecting and promoting basic freedoms across the world and also reflect on how far we have to go.  

In recognition of Human Rights Day, I would like to give special acknowledgement to the many individuals, civil society organizations, and NGOs that work every day to promote democratic principles and to advocate for human rights in Cambodia.  The U.S. Embassy in Cambodia is proud to stand with you.  The knowledge, dedication, and passion that you demonstrate in your work serve as an inspiration to all.

During my time in Cambodia, I have followed the human rights situation closely.  There have been some improvements, but there have also been setbacks.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is incorporated into the Constitution of the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia, but living up to the principles enshrined in the UDHR requires constant effort and attention. 

I encourage all Cambodians to take this day to rededicate themselves to promoting basic human rights and freedoms.  In particular, I urge the government to engage with the opposition and civil society to address the issues of impunity, nepotism, and corruption, which together have a corrosive effect on society, weakening economic growth and stability, and undercutting progress made on human rights.  It is incumbent on all parties to set aside petty differences and to work together for the benefit of the people of Cambodia.

The United States remains deeply committed to the protection of human rights in order to secure the peace, deter aggression, promote the rule of law, combat crime and corruption, strengthen democracies, and prevent humanitarian crises.  This commitment is evident in our work with all levels of government and society.  We look forward to continuing our partnership with all sectors of Cambodian society to promote the universal freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Cambodian Constitution.

By Ambassador William Todd

This past weekend, I was privileged to speak to a remarkable group of young women at the opening ceremony of a two-week leadership institute sponsored by the Women in Public Service Project, the Harpswell Foundation, and Pannasastra University.  A total of 63 young women are participating in the institute, where they will hear from experts and participate in workshops on critical thinking, leadership, ethics, and public service.  These young women represent a new generation of Cambodian women who are ready to make a positive impact on society and to take on leadership roles in their communities.

In my remarks, I shared my thoughts about the importance of having more women in leadership positions in Cambodia and the three things that women and girls need to achieve their full potential:  Opportunity, Equality, and Access.  Without opportunity, equality, and access, women and girls will always be at a disadvantage compared to their male counterparts.  Why? These three pillars are what I see as the necessary tools to build a capable and confident generation of women leaders in business, science, education, and policymaking, in effect a more productive and responsible society.  The leadership institute is one small but important step towards achieving these objectives, and I am encouraged by the possibilities and creativity the institute fosters.

This gives me an opportunity to describe the vision behind the Women in Public Service Project, which was launched in 2011 by the U.S. Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.  With support from the U.S. Department of State, the Women in Public Service Project develops partnerships around the world to advance the pillars I mentioned above, opportunity, equality, and access

The Harpswell Foundation and Pannasastra University of Cambodia (PUC) are the hosts of this months leadership institute in Cambodia.  The Harpswell Foundation was founded by U.S. academic and humanitarian Alan Lightman and operates two facilities in Phnom Penh that provide housing and support for outstanding Cambodian women while they attend university.  PUC is one of Cambodias premier private universities and a frequent U.S. Embassy partner.  The south campus in Phnom Penh also hosts an Embassy-sponsored American Corner and an Educational Advising Center, which provides free counseling about opportunities to study in the United States. 

Joining me at the launch was the director of the Women in Public Service Project, Dr. Rangita de Silva de Alwis.  Dr. de Silva de Alwis made an impassioned appeal to Cambodias young women, encouraging them to promote themselves and to fight for greater opportunity.

Another speaker at the inauguration was H.E. Dr. Ing Kantha Phavi, Cambodias Minister of Womens Affairs.  I want to personally thank Minister Phavi for sharing her valuable perspective on the steps that the Cambodian government is taking to encourage women to take on positions of leadership in government and society.  Dr. Phavi herself is an excellent example of the positive impact that women can have in government and public policy in Cambodia.

In recent blog entries, I discussed the importance of creating opportunities for women to succeed in government, business, and other fields and described some of the many ways that the U.S. Embassy supports womens development and equality in Cambodia.  It is truly gratifying to be able to lend my support to partners like the Women in Public Service Project, the Harpswell Foundation, and Pannasastra University who share our interest in helping Cambodian women to become leaders.  I wish the participants in the leadership institute the best of luck and look forward to following their progress in the future.

This project has already helped to create more than 60 businesses, 250 new jobs, and were going to be starting a parallel center in Vietnam this year. The reason is very straightforward: No country in the world can get ahead if it leaves half its population behind. And in most countries, women are half the population or more. And no economy can thrive unless women are empowered and equipped to contribute to a strong and stable and prosperous society.  Secretary of State John Kerry

The U.S. Embassy and the Royal Government of Cambodia signed two bilateral agreements this morning to provide $35 million in assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development USAID Cambodia for programs in health, agriculture, environment, and education.  The agreements were signed at the Council for the Development of Cambodia by Deputy Prime Minister Keat Chhon and USAID Mission Director Rebecca Black, with U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia William Heidt serving as a witness.

These agreements are the first part of a three-year, $137 million program from #USAID to support the Cambodian Government's national development plan.  The programs, which will be implemented primarily by non-governmental organizations, will boost the quality of healthcare, improve nutrition for mothers and children, reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases, expand agriculture markets and production, strengthen protections for Cambodia's natural resources, and help young students strengthen their reading skills.

In his remarks, Ambassador Heidt emphasized the strong collaboration between USAID and the government, saying I am very grateful for the partnership between our two countries over the past two decades.  Together, we have worked to address many key development challenges.  Together, weve pushed back HIV/AIDS from its dangerous levels in the 1990s.   Together, weve helped farmers increase their yields and enabled them to feed, educate, and access healthcare for their families.  And together, weve worked with Cambodians to take advantage of innovations in science and technology to improve many aspects of life.

DAY 9
""We are finally in Washington D.C. The train completely stops even though I still feel it's moving. Walking across Washington Union Station, my first impression is the city is full of historical buildings. The design and architecture of the building are so classic, historic and unique. I didn't get a chance to try the public transportation but Uber is clearly my favorite transportation in the United States. You can get a taxi whenever and wherever you are within 3 to 5 minutes through your mobile phone. It is even more convenient in DC. The weather in DC makes me feel like home. It was hot and humid. We headed to United States Capitol right away after getting off the train. I feel so privileged to be able to visit the US Capitol through Millennial Trains Project. It was quite a hectic day because we need to rush to the bus, heading to our next stop, Baltimore, Maryland. I have no interview schedule in Baltimore due to the sudden change of the plan. Nevertheless, I had a great time with my lovely Fulbright friends from Poland and South Africa. ""We first went to Starbucks to charge our phone and laptop, and finish some works. Then we took Uber to Inner Harbor to sight-saw the city."", we told people when they asked about how we spent our day in Baltimore. They were surprised by how much we were into American culture because that's what Americans like to do: Starbucks, Uber, sightseeing. Well, I'm glad to know and be able to adapt to it. Inner Harbor is a landmark, historic seaport and tourist attraction of the city. We (MTP members) had a great dinner at Little Havana. Then we took a bus back to Washington DC. Oh wait! Did I mention that we still have another night on the train? But not a moving train anymore.""

""A number of new voices have recently joined the healthy debate that continues to take place regarding the draft NGO law.

For example, a statement released this week by the ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights  an organization that includes high-ranking government officials from Cambodia and other nations throughout Southeast Asia  shows that the draft NGO law is an issue that is receiving both national and international attention.

In my opinion, it is a positive sign that Cambodias neighbors are not only focused on the upcoming ASEAN economic integration; they also recognize the important role that civil society plays throughout the region.

As the draft law next moves to the National Assembly for further discussion, I hope that Cambodias leaders will carefully consider all views  most of all the views of the Cambodian people  prior to making any final decisions.

This diverse collection of voices will be a key element in the formula for healthy reform that will lead to a more prosperous Cambodia.""

-From the Ambassador's Penh

The Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative  known to many as YSEALI  recently celebrated its first anniversary.  Since the creation of President Obamas signature program for promoting youth leadership and networking in the region, more than 1,000 Cambodian youth have joined thousands more of their peers throughout Southeast Asia to not only discuss topics such as entrepreneurship and civic engagement, but also to take significant action to address issues that matter most in their communities.  As a reader of my blog, you are probably familiar with my excitement about YSEALI and the potential that I believe it has for creating the next generation of leaders in Cambodia.   

YSEALI has provided a number of opportunities and tools to support Cambodias youth.  Workshops in Manila and Kuala Lumpur featured enthusiastic Cambodian participants who were among the first to win grant money to create a YSEALI regional project.  Called Streams of Hope, this innovative project involved youth from Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Philippines to promote the importance of river rehabilitation.  In November, 20 YSEALI participants  two from each ASEAN member nation  met in Rangoon to examine how collaboration within their fields of interest can lead to a bigger impact in their communities and throughout the region.  In December, the U.S. Embassy sent six young Cambodians to Singapore to participate in a regional workshop entitled YSEALI Generation: The Power of Human Capital.  With help from the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, YSEALI members were able to identify the soft skills that are crucial to gaining a quality job and ensuring career advancement. 

I was delighted to learn that the some of the young Cambodians that traveled to Singapore volunteered to serve as Digital Delegates during the workshop, using social media to give updates and respond to questions about YSEALI.  Talking about their experience and their plans upon returning home, one participant said: 

With all the valuable skills I have acquired during this workshop, I am committed to bringing back skills to share with youth in my community.  For this reason, I have initiated a project to strengthen human capital in my home country by conducting a series of informal sharing sessions with youth who are in need of soft skills, as a preparation for those seeking improvement to reach their full potential in their career. 

Utilizing Facebook and the popular #YSEALI on Twitter, these stories are being shared with others in Cambodia and around the world.  Social media is clearly having a significant impact on the success of YSEALI, and I look forward to speaking with more of you about the efforts of these young people in 2015.  

YSEALI is creating stronger links between rising leaders in Cambodia and their regional and U.S. counterparts working on matters of mutual interest.  Cambodia is among the top countries with applicants for the YSEALI Professional Fellows Program, which sends some of the best and brightest community leaders from ASEAN to the United States for one month to engage with experts in the fields of civic engagement, NGO management, economic empowerment, governance, legislative process, and environmental and natural resources management.  After a successful program in 2014, the number of applications for the spring 2015 program has tripled from the region, reaching new audiences by attracting more than half from outside the capital cities.   

I would like to congratulate everyone for their hard work and commitment to YSEALI in its first year.  This initiative has created an amazing network of young people working together to address issues that are important to Cambodians and others in Southeast Asia.  I could not be more proud of the program, and I invite all between the ages of 18 and 35 to join this active and growing community.  To find out more about YSEALI and sign up for membership, please go to https://youngsoutheastasianleaders.state.gov/.

by Ambassador Todd

Two weeks ago I had the great pleasure to welcome an important new member to the U.S. Embassy team  Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung.  The Deputy Chief of Mission, or DCM for short, is the number two position in the Embassy and is often considered to be the chief operating officer because of the many roles and responsibilities that he or she handles.  The DCM is the right hand of the Ambassador and serves as the acting Ambassador, or Charg dAffaires, in the Ambassadors absence.

The best DCMs share certain characteristics, including an intense curiosity, strong management skills, and a keen diplomatic touch.  Anyone who has met Julie knows that she has all of these qualities and more.  Julie is full of energy and enthusiasm and brings a genuine love of diplomacy and foreign cultures to her new position.  She truly wants to make a positive impact in the world and she understands how to bring people together to address the challenges of the 21st century.

Julie is a highly experienced career Foreign Service Officer who has worked in many of the State Departments most important and challenging posts around the world, including Iraq and Colombia.  Most recently Julie headed the Economic section in Bangkok, where she and her team worked to develop closer economic and trade ties between Thailand and the United States.  This experience will serve her well here in Cambodia, where trade and economic cooperation forms the backbone of the U.S.-Cambodia bilateral relationship.  She also has extensive experience coordinating development programs and promoting human rights  two other cornerstones of the U.S. relationship with Cambodia.  Her particular interest in engaging civil society will further expand opportunities to have a dialogue with those of diverse backgrounds and opinions.

Julie has spent much of her career in Asia.  Besides Thailand, she also served in Vietnam, Japan, and China, and covered Korea from our headquarters in Washington.  Julies interest in Asia stems in part from her personal background.  Julie was born in South Korea, and her family emigrated to the United States when she was five years old.  At the time Julie didnt speak any English, but with a work ethic instilled in her by her parents she channeled her efforts towards becoming a public servant.  Julie is proficient in seven languages, and spent the past year studying Khmer in Washington, DC.

Julies life and career path has brought her to Cambodia at a very special time in this countrys history, with the new National Assembly just beginning its work.  Julie will be using all of her skills and talents to strengthen the U.S.-Cambodian relationship and to help our partners to address the challenges that Cambodians face every day.  I am proud to have her on the U.S. Embassy team.

Please join me in welcoming Julie to Cambodia in the comments section.  And when you meet Julie, be sure to make her practice her Khmer!

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Wherever I go in Cambodia, I am constantly impressed by the energy and enthusiasm of the young people that I meet.  Cambodias young adults have high hopes and expectations and they are driving change in this country  not simply waiting for it to happen.  They want to know how they can work together with other young people in the region to help make a positive impact in their communities and the world.  Todays youth want a cleaner environment, responsible economic development, and more opportunities to create a world of peace and prosperity.  They do not shy away from hard work and challenges in order to achieve these dreams.

That is why I believe that Cambodia can be a model country for the Young Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative, known as YSEALI, to thrive.  YSEALI was launched by President Obama in 2013 and brings together bright young leaders aged 18-35 from Cambodia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma, Philippines, Laos, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  The purpose of YSEALI is to encourage young people with a vision from across the ASEAN region to work together to find innovative solutions to challenges such as economic development and environmental protection.  YSEALI members can network, learn, share ideas, and even apply for funding for projects that address real-world challenges.

Who can join YSEALI? Any Cambodian between the ages of 18 and 35 can go to the website and click on the link Become a Member.  https://youngsoutheastasianleaders.state.gov/join/  When you do, you will be instantly connected to a community that is already 7,000 strong and growing quickly.  This is an exciting time to get in on the ground floor and to play a part in YSEALIs development, especially as Cambodia prepares to host the first major YSEALI event of 2015: a youth summit convening dozens of YSEALI members from across the region.

So far, more than 750 Cambodians have already signed up for YSEALI, making Cambodia one of the biggest groups.  Cambodias YSEALI members are already starting to make a difference.  This last weekend, a team from Cambodia organized a visit by a U.S. professor of environmental science, Dr. Eric Pallant, who shared his expertise about keeping rivers and waterways healthy.  This visit was part of a project called Streams of Hope, which is promoting new solutions to significant environmental problems.  You can read more about Dr. Pallants visit on our Facebook page.

Streams of Hope is one example of how YSEALI members in Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Philippines came together to make clean water a reality by raising awareness about water systems and conservation.  The initiative has already carried out a number of programs, including a workshop on environmental protection in Kratie province in July.  I am very proud that Cambodians are playing a leading role in Streams of Hope, which is one of the pioneer projects of YSEALI.

Three other great projects from Cambodia have already been approved for funding and will be getting underway soon, thanks to the YSEALI Seeds for the Future program, which offered up to $10,000 for teams from at least two ASEAN countries to carry out a program.  In one of these projects, youth from Cambodia and Thailand will work together to promote good governance and to battle corruption.  A second project in Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand will bring together urban and rural youth to help them be more competitive in the workforce and provide entrepreneurial training.  A third project will support the full inclusion of women in society in Cambodia and Burma.  I know that there are many issues and challenges that the young people of Cambodia want to tackle, and even more creative ideas that YSEALI can help foster.

In addition to special projects, YSEALI also brings together youth from around the region at workshops where they can learn from experts and from each other.  It is through this networking, mentoring, and hands-on training, that young people can lead communities in addressing economic, environmental, educational, and civic engagement issues. 

When U.S. President Barack Obama was young, he started out as a community organizer ensuring people in his community received job training and help in getting a university degree. He knows from personal experience that young people can be powerful agents for good in their communities. YSEALI carries on President Obamas legacy by fostering community leadership among youth in ASEAN member countries. 

As you can see, YSEALI is a dynamic network of young people who are working together to address issues that are important to Southeast Asia.  I could not be more excited about this program.  If you are between 18 and 35 and want to be a part of this active and growing community, please consider becoming a member.  I invite everyone  especially parents and teachers  to go to the website to learn more about YSEALI and to encourage young Cambodian leaders to sign up.  You can find all of the information here: https://youngsoutheastasianleaders.state.gov/.

What do you think about the YSEALI initiative?  Please let us know in the comments section or on Facebook or Twitter (@USEmbPhnomPenh).

I am currently doing my masters degree in Hydrology and Hydrodynamics, generally known as Water Resources Engineering, at the University of Washington. I choose this major field of study because I want to make a difference in Cambodia's future and improve the well-being of Cambodia and its people through sustainable development in water resources. Cambodia has several water-related issues ranging from water quality to sewage and water management system. I plan to use the knowledge and practical skills from my study in the United States to develop more human resources in water resources engineering, and together with other professionals, I strongly believe that we can sustainably solve these water-related problems by developing wastewater treatment plants, hydraulic structures and electric energy generation to response to the growing water demand, environmental threats and projected global climate change.

Active in more than 160 countries, the Fulbright Program offers grants to study, teach and conduct research for non-U.S. citizens to come to the United States and for U.S. citizens to go abroad.

The Royal Government of #Cambodia and USAID Cambodia implementing partner Wildlife Conservation Society signed a carbon credit project agreement on August 11, 2016, witnessed by Ambassador Heidt and Minister of Environment H.E. Say Samal. This agreement will implement Cambodia's first large-scale private-sector sale of carbon credits, which will benefit an important climate change mitigation project in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, which covers 300,000 hectares in Mondulkiri province.

    (REDD+)            '

The carbon credit transfer took place under the UN-backed Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation program (REDD+). This transfer will avoid 14 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions over a 10-year period between 2010 and 2019.

  Heidt    REDD+    

In his remarks, Ambassador Heidt said that this new agreement would ""lay the groundwork for additional REDD+ agreements in the future that will benefit both Cambodias forests and the communities that live in and around them""

The U.S. Embassy believes strongly in the power of English and works hard to promote English-language instruction in Cambodia, both through direct scholarships and through teacher training.  The U.S. governments flagship program is the English Access Microscholarship Program, which offers two-year English language scholarships to disadvantaged teenagers around the world.  In Cambodia, the Embassy currently works with outstanding partner institutions such as the Islamic Community Kan Imam-San of Cambodia in Kampong Chhnang and the American Education Center in Phnom Penh, who teach lessons at six locations across the country.  More than 1000 Cambodian students have participated in the program since it began in 2004.



All of these programs have one overarching goal: to increase Cambodias competitiveness.  Speaking English helps Cambodians to pursue an education, to get great jobs, and to give back to the community.  Most of all, it makes it possible for the Cambodian people to contribute to the global conversation and to have their voices heard by more people in more places.  By improving their abilities in English, young Cambodians in particular are setting themselves apart from their peers in the region and around the world and putting themselves in a position to drive Cambodias development.

There they saw a nearly 200-kilogram fragment believed to be from a Krishna Lifting Mount Govardhan statue, originally found at Phnom Da in 1935 and returned by the  National Museum to the CMA in October 2015. The CMA plans to exhibit the restored Krishna statue in 2017.

The CMA has a very active cooperative agreement with the Ministry of Culture and Fine Art ( :) and the National Museum. In May 2015, it voluntarily returned to #Cambodia a 10th-century statue of Hanuman after uncovering evidence that it was likely looted during Cambodias civil war. At the same time, the CMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cultural cooperation with the National Museum, the first such agreement between the National Museum and a U.S. museum.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Despite an impressive rate of economic growth in Cambodia over the past several years, many young Cambodians are still facing challenges in finding good-paying jobs. One reason for this is that employers are increasingly looking to hire workers who have already demonstrated the skills that they need to perform. If young people entering the work force do not yet possess the right skills, employers may overlook otherwise promising hiring opportunities. One way that businesses, governments, and organizations can help bridge these gaps is through internships, a practice that is widely used in the United States.

I strongly believe that the work experience young people gain through internship programs can serve as a catalyst for professional success. That is why the U.S. Embassy runs a yearly summer internship program for promising Cambodian university students. We just concluded this years internship program where twelve interns gained valuable work experience in the areas of financial management, consular affairs, information technology, human resources, public affairs, program management, and procurement. We are extremely thankful for their meaningful contributions. I hope this unique experience will provide each of them with the confidence and skills that will open doors to more opportunities.

In order to further tap the potential of Cambodias bright students, my Youth Council has partnered with the American Chamber of Commerce to place highly qualified students in internship positions with some excellent companies. The Youth Council has also organized internship workshops which offer training on resum writing, preparing for a job interview, office etiquette, and professional ethics. More than 300 young Cambodians have attended these workshops and more than thirty internship candidates in the program have been successfully placed with twenty different companies in Cambodia.

In the United States, we find that many executives once started off as interns. In 1972, Bill Gates was an intern for the U.S. House of Representatives. Just two years after his internship, Gates co-founded Microsoft, one of the worlds leading corporations. Steven Spielberg was an intern before becoming a global icon in moviemaking. My Deputy at the Embassy was once a State Department intern who enjoyed the experience so much it led to her applying to become a diplomat.

Internships can and should be beneficial both to the hiring company and to the intern. In many cases, what hiring managers want and what applicants offer are very different. The gap between the skills presented and the skills required can be remedied by providing on-the-job training. Joining an organization or company as an intern provides a student the opportunity to work hands-on in a professional environment while also helping an employer evaluate how the student would fare in the actual workplace. It serves as a sort of test run for both the student and employer.

Interns are also valuable to employers for many reasons. In addition to creating an effective pathway for hiring, interns fill positions and assist employers with innovative ideas and technology. Young motivated interns can add fresh perspectives and ideas to increase organizational productivity while giving students a space to develop professionally.

I hope more employers continue to see the value of hands-on internship programs designed to mentor and cultivate todays young leaders, strengthen their understanding of the job market, and prepare them for future career opportunities.

If you are interested in an internship at the U.S. Embassy, please keep updated about future opportunities as information is posted on our website and our Facebook page.

All over the world, every day, Americas diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing for. 

Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and generous nation.

In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed in marble.

Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.

Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other peoples hopes his own.

In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libyas revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to Benghazi.

The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking  indeed, I asked myself  how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.

But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group  not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded. Libyans carried Chris body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.

The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in Americas interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies, consulates, and citizens.

There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet. Americas commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear  there is no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.

It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. Its an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm. And now it is a day on which we will remember Sean, Chris, and their colleagues.

May God bless them, and may God bless the thousands of Americans working in every corner of the world who make this country the greatest force for peace, prosperity, and progress, and a force that has always stood for human dignity  the greatest force the world has ever known. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.

Thank you.

Our goal is to inform more people about this global conservation crisis.

Attacks on rhinos and elephants are multiplying at an alarming rate.

Species around the globe such as tigers in Asia are endangered.

By some estimates, the black market for wildlife trafficking is rivaled in size only by the illegal arms and drug trade.

The slaughter of endangered species robs communities of income from tourism, reduces biodiversity, encourages corruption, undermines good governance.

That's why we are training officials and educating prosecutors about wildlife crimes and helping countries strengthen their enforcement laws.

But we cant do this without you.

Please, join us. Become part of the solution.

You have the choice to refuse to purchase products made from endangered wildlife.

Together we can save these animals before it is too late.

Stand up and speak out, and stop this trade.

Now, thanks to a new project supported by USAID Cambodia, for the first time ever Cambodian banks have agreed to consider environmental and social impacts when making decisions about what projects to support. This agreement sets a new model for the region for corporate social responsibility by major banking institutions.

The new commitment was signed on Monday by Association of Banks in Cambodia (ABC) acting chairman Charles Vann. The ABC designed the language with technical support from USAID's Mekong Partnership for the Environment (MPE) regional program.

In this picture, a Cambodian farmer ploughs his rice field after the flood subsides. Challenging climate conditions like drought and floods resulting from climate change can be overwhelming for Cambodian small farmers.  Government programs like USAID's Feed the Future help them by drawing on the latest innovations including improved plant breeding techniques, knowledge of behavior change, and enhanced information about pests and diseases.

The private sector also plays an important role in ensuring a healthy planet.  On October 20-21, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will convene the Secretarys Climate and Clean Energy Investment Forum which will bring together investors, corporations, philanthropies, and policymakers to discuss the impact that climate and clean energy investments can have in the fight against global climate change.

On July 7, #AmbHeidt visited the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76), one of 10 U.S. Navy aircraft carriers that are in active service. He arrived via a U.S. Navy C-2 Greyhound airplane, undergoing an arrested landing and experiencing a catapult launch on the way back to #Cambodia. During his time aboard the ship, the Ambassador observed flight operations, talked with senior leadership, and also met the ship's ""Sailor of the Year"" and learned that she is married to a Cambodian! This visit was an amazing experience, showcasing U.S. military-to-military capability and underscoring our mutual interest in regional maritime security.  

Since August 2015, the USS Ronald Reagans home port has been Yokosuka, Japan. The ship has an established history of operating in the Pacific. This includes providing assistance after the 2011 tsunami in Japan, which ably demonstrated the ships potential for contributing to regional security.

What would you get a robot to do for you? The potential of robots was discussed last Friday at the inaugural Conference on Robotics in #Cambodia, a joint endeavor by the U.S.-based NGO GOLDEN WEST HUMANITARIAN FOUNDATION, MoEYS Cambodia, and Villanova University in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. With funding from the U.S. Department of State, Cambodian engineers have collaborated with U.S. university students to develop robots that can be used for demining efforts. In addition to these projects, the conference introduced Cambodian students to opportunities in #STEM and served as a platform for how future technology could be used in Cambodia.

Young children in Cambodia are also excited about robots! Last month, the Liger Learning Center and Development Innovations Cambodia - supported by USAID Cambodia - hosted an event called ""Robotics Basics"" that introduced robotics to students in grades 4-6. The students were able to share their knowledge and enthusiasm while encouraging others to learn more about robotics.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Readers of my blog know that I take great pride in writing about individuals and organizations that work to improve the quality of life for all Cambodians.  Today, I would like to highlight a remarkable organization that is making an enormous contribution in the field of labor rights:  the Solidarity Center.  As the non-governmental organization (NGO) affiliate of the American Federation of Labour (AFL-CIO), the Solidarity Center has programs in over 60 countries around the world, working with independent trade unions to promote workers rights and to conduct labor law advocacy.  Under the leadership of Canadian citizen David Welsh, the Solidarity Center in Cambodia has received praise for its high level of engagement with important stakeholders including the Royal Government of Cambodia, international corporations, the United Nations International Labor Organization (ILO), and various partners in the human and labor rights NGO community.

Over the past decade, much of the discussion on trade unions, labor rights, and the minimum wage in Cambodia has been related to the garment sector.  As the countrys top foreign currency earner, the industry has greatly contributed to Cambodias economic growth while providing opportunities for many Cambodians to supplement their incomes.  But there are also major concerns about salaries, unsafe conditions, and the overall treatment of workers.  The Solidarity Center has been deeply engaged in advocacy responses to these and other issues in the garment sector.  They played a significant role in the recent negotiations over the minimum wage and continue to work on key reforms, including Cambodia's proposed Trade Union law and the National Social Security Fund, which seeks to broaden the economic security of Cambodian workers.

The Solidarity Center provides support to trade unions and workers in every major sector in Cambodia through training and advocacy.  In addition to the garment sector, this also includes construction, hospitality and tourism, civil service, and education.  One of the areas of emphasis is promoting collective bargaining, which allows workers to negotiate with management as a group, giving them more leverage than they would have as individuals.  In recent years, the organization has also been at the forefront of legal proceedings involving the welfare of workers, helping to establish government, international brand, and industry liability in several cases regarding bankruptcy, accidents, and fatalities.  

Earlier this week, the U.S. Embassy hosted a roundtable discussion for members of a U.S. Congressional Delegation led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.  The delegation met with key leaders in civil society to learn about a number of issues in Cambodia, including the recent Human Rights Watch report on garment factories.  I was pleased that Solidarity Center Cambodia Director David Welsh was able to join us.  His insights on workers rights and the conditions of garment factories in Cambodia were highly valued by the delegation members.

I greatly appreciate the efforts of the Solidarity Center to protect and advance workers rights through training, support, and advocacy.  The U.S. government is proud to support labor rights in Cambodia, especially since the United States is Cambodias largest trading partner, with approximately 40 percent of all Cambodian exports  the bulk of which are from the garment industry  bound for the United States.  Cambodias strong economic growth would not be possible without the valuable partnerships that the Solidarity Center has established with the Cambodian government, garment buyers, and other stakeholders.  By continuing to work together with the Solidarity Center and other organizations in both the public and private sectors, we can improve working conditions, encourage corporate social responsibility, strengthen commercial ties, and create economic opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Cambodians.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Over the course of my two-and-a-half years in Cambodia, I have been fortunate to have met with many dedicated individuals who are making a difference in the lives of the Cambodian people.  Two of these people will be departing Cambodia shortly, and before they leave, I want to highlight their important contributions  those of Jill Tucker, program manager at Better Factories Cambodia, and Laura Thornton, senior director at the National Democratic Institute.

For the past three years, Jill Tucker has been leading the efforts of Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) to improve working conditions for Cambodias 600,000 garment workers.  BFC monitors working conditions in Cambodian factories, helping to improve those conditions and make labor policies more transparent.  Perhaps Jills most important legacy is making BFCs findings available to the public in an online database.  

BFCs programs also support workers by educating them on the labor law and helping them better understand their rights.  One example of how BFC promotes workers rights is through the use of mobile phone technologies.  The Kamako Chhnoeum (outstanding worker in Khmer) mobile phone project is an interactive voice response system which allows factory workers to call toll-free to take a short quiz that will help them learn about labor rights, occupational health and safety, and personal health.  Another mobile phone application provides an interactive and searchable version of BFCs guide to the labor law, putting valuable information in the hands of workers, factory management, and others who work in the garment industry.

With an excellent record of BFC achievements, there is no doubt Jills efforts have been instrumental in assisting Cambodian workers, while at the same time creating opportunities for the garment industry to improve its reputation for providing decent working conditions.

Laura Thornton has been leading the way at the National Democratic Institute (NDI) for the past six years, and during that time she has tirelessly championed for strengthening Cambodias democracy.  Lauras work in Cambodia actually began in 1997, when she served as a consultant for USAID in Phnom Penh.  Her extensive work to empower citizens with the information they need to make informed choices has made a powerful impact.  During last years national elections, NDI held the countrys only candidate debate between representatives of the major political parties.  The televised debate was broadcast nationwide to make information about the political parties more accessible to voters.

Further expanding access to information, NDI has conducted constituency dialogues across Cambodia for the past ten years.  These town hall meetings provide an important opportunity for citizens to present unscripted questions to ruling party and opposition lawmakers.  Laura and NDI have also worked in partnership with other civil society organizations in the Electoral Reform Alliance (ERA).  NDI provided expertise in support of an ERA report which provided an analysis of public electoral data showing fundamental problems in Cambodias election system.  This report became a key talking point during the negotiations to end the nearly year-long political stalemate between the major political parties, and can be the basis for an electoral reform that boosts public confidence that voters voices are being heard.  

I am personally grateful for all of the hard work and important contributions of Jill and Laura over the past several years.  I know all of us who have interacted and worked alongside these civil society champions join me in wishing them both all the best as they pursue the next chapters in their lives.  Jill and Laura, thank you for your dedication to improving the lives of the Cambodian people.  You have truly made a difference.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Have you ever had a mentor or been a mentor to someone?  If you have, then you probably recognize the impact that mentoring can have on a person.  But if you think that you have never been a part of this kind of relationship, it might have to do with how you define mentoring.  So what exactly is mentoring?  There are many different ways to answer this question, but a basic definition is that a mentor is someone who works with others in a positive, constructive way so that both mentor and mentee have the potential to grow through the relationship.  Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that mentoring is not an event  it is a collaborative process.  Benjamin Franklin once said, Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.  Open and honest interaction between mentor and mentee not only ensures trust; it also guarantees that both individuals will benefit from the relationship. 

I have been a mentor and been mentored my entire career.  One of my mentors along the way taught me two valuable lessons: you have to be able to take risks to grow, and it is fine to make mistakes as long as learn from them.  I also learned that you are never too old to grow and develop. Since I have been here in Cambodia, I have continued to be mentored by closely working with civil society.  I am very grateful for the knowledge and experiences that they have shared with me, and I sincerely believe that I am a better leader today because of their support and ideas.

As President Obama said in his 2014 proclamation that recognized January as National Mentoring Month in the United States, Mentors push our next generation to shape their ambitions, set a positive course, and achieve their boundless potential.  I believe that effective leaders always give back, especially to younger generations.  This is a driving force behind our work with the Ambassadors Youth Council (AYC).  Aside from advising me on the concerns of youth in Cambodia, AYC members serve as mentors to other Cambodians, helping people gain access to valuable work experiences, educational resources, and skill-building activities that will help improve their lives and the lives of others.

With approximately 70 percent of the population being under the age of 30, it is clear that Cambodias future would greatly benefit from mentoring.  Recognizing the value of youth, political parties have created programs for mentoring and information sharing, with both the Cambodian Peoples Party and the Cambodian National Rescue Party establishing their own youth councils.  A number of civil society groups in Cambodia have also developed initiatives that encourage mentoring as a means of empowering the next generation of leaders.  By embracing the role of the mentor, the leaders of today can help educate and inspire young Cambodians, improving their chances of securing better academic and professional opportunities in the future.

Mentoring can come in many forms.  For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) helps to ensure that midwives and other certified health providers in Cambodia learn life-saving skills and practices through training, coaching, and mentoring activities.  Development Innovations  another project funded by USAID  is also promoting mentoring to grow a community of innovators in Cambodia.  Through its Mentor Network, local and international mentors provide support for mentees with promising technology-based initiatives.  With the knowledge and experience gained from civil society, technology development, and social enterprise, these mentors assist others in creating solutions that make Cambodia a better place for everyone.

Later this year, 250 young leaders from throughout the ASEAN region will be selected as YSEALI Professional Fellows, serving for five weeks in non-profit organizations and government offices in the United States.  Working directly with their American counterparts, the YSEALI Professional Fellows will enhance their practical expertise, leadership skills, and professional contacts in the fields of civic engagement, NGO management, governance, law, economics, and environmental and natural resources management.  When the young Cambodians participating in this program return home, they have the potential to become remarkable mentors for others seeking to address challenges and create new opportunities.  In fact, one of the most powerful aspects of YSEALI is that it serves as a natural conduit for mentoring.  This is one of the reasons why I am encouraged by the substantial number of youth in Cambodia getting involved with YSEALI.

Is mentoring right for you?  Do you want to be a mentor or a mentee?  Please share your comments, follow us on social media, and go to our U.S. Embassy website for more information about these and other opportunities.

Step Two:  Finance Your Studies
   
Don't let the cost of studying in the United States scare you! 
Make a budget and write down a list of resources that can assist you in paying for the program you want to attend. 

As you prepare your budget, keep in mind that costs are determined by the institutions tuition charges, classroom supplies and living expenses, such as room and board and health insurance. 

So where do most of the reliable sources of funding for school abroad come from? 
Depending on the type of program you choose, the following may be available:

        Scholarships
        Grants
        Student Exchange Programs

You might also obtain funding from:

        Social, Community, or Non-governmental organizations
        Multinational companies or local businesses

In recent weeks, we have seen hundreds of people marching into the capital to protest over land concessions, bringing renewed attention to this long-standing issue.  Land is a finite resource, and increased population growth and economic activity put an increasing strain on public lands.  A fair and effective land management policy that advances economic development and also protects individual rights is something that individual families and businesses both demand. 

Last week, Samdech Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed his own concerns about land concessions and called for greater accountability by local officials in the handling of land disputes.  It was also reported that the Prime Minister set up a new high-level inter-ministerial committee to review whether companies are abiding by the rules of the economic land concessions, which is a promising idea.  For Cambodian citizens who have been affected by land concessions, the Prime Ministers call for action has raised hope that positive changes may be within reach, but implementation will be key.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Cambodias economy has been one of the fastest growing in the world over the past decade.  As the country continues to reform and improve its business and foreign investment climate, a key element for further economic growth is the increased presence of entrepreneurs in Cambodia, particularly among women.  With last months visit of First Lady Michelle Obama and the celebration of International Womens Day, we were once again reminded of how women and girls are critically important to families and communities in Cambodia, just as they are in the United States and around the world.  By unleashing the creativity, drive, and sound judgment of women we can help more women in Cambodia become successful entrepreneurs.

This is why I was delighted to see that Julie Chung, my Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy, participated in a recent seminar on entrepreneurship for Cambodian women, co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.  Along with Ministry of Womens Affairs Secretary of State Chan Sorey and Japanese Ambassador Yuji Kumamaru, Julie joined more than 100 Cambodian business owners, aspiring entrepreneurs, and NGO representatives for this event that addressed barriers to womens entry into business in Cambodia.  With panelists from U.S. companies including General Electrics Country Manager Dararith Lim and U.S. social entrepreneur Janice Wilson, discussions on womens economic empowerment were led by business executives and experts from the United States, Japan, and Cambodia.

The event was part of joint efforts between the United States and Japan to expand regional cooperation through the Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI).  The U.S. Department of State is also working with the Ministry of Womens Affairs on the Womens Entrepreneurial Centers of Resources, Education, Access, and Training for Economic Empowerment (WECREATE) Program.  One of the main outcomes of the LMI WECREATE Program will be the establishment of a womens entrepreneurial center in Phnom Penh in late 2015.  At this center, women will have a safe and centralized location with resources that will allow established businesses to build capacity and newer microenterprises to move from the informal sector into the formal sector, both of which generate momentum for measurable economic and societal change in Cambodia.

Through efforts like the entrepreneurship seminar and the future WECREATE center, women will have better access to the resources they need to start and develop their own businesses.  But we have also learned that entrepreneurs are even more likely to succeed when they develop support networks with local business mentors and role models who can provide advice and services.  This is why I think organizations like the Cambodia Women Entrepreneurs Association (CWEA) are so vital to the countrys development of future business leaders.  Others can learn a lot from the expertise of CWEA members  women that have been successful in a range of business sectors, including food production, hospitality, handicrafts, and telecommunications.  

The United States is proud to assist Cambodian women to receive quality education, resources, and mentoring to support their specific needs to start, scale, and grow businesses.  By connecting women around the world and providing access to opportunity, we can accelerate growth and enhance economic prosperity for all Cambodians.

Do you have any thoughts about women and entrepreneurship in Cambodia?  Please share your comments.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Cambodia has been recognized for making tremendous progress in the prevention and treatment of HIV.  In the past decade, Cambodia has cut adult HIV infection rates by more than half, and today more than 80 percent of patients diagnosed with HIV receive life-saving treatment.  Many people in the country remain at a high risk of HIV infection, however, so it is critical to continue to expand the reach of HIV services and health information to hard-to-reach groups.  

Thats why I am so excited about yesterdays release of an innovative tool to help fight against new HIV infections in Cambodia.  The mobile health platform  called mHealth  was launched this week by USAIDs Cambodia HIV/AIDS Flagship project in collaboration with the National AIDS Authority and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.  The Cambodia HIV/AIDS Flagship project is a consortium of local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) funded by the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  The mHealth platform is an example of how the U.S. government partners with the Royal Government of Cambodia and NGOs to provide potentially life-saving HIV-related information and services to underserved populations, including  entertainment workers.

In a previous blog, I mentioned how mobile phones can help improve the lives of people by providing access to information.  The mHealth platform is an example of mobile phone technology being used to help at-risk populations receive access to the HIV information and services they need.  The mHealth platform features Voice4U, a mobile phone interactive voice response system that provides callers with on-line counseling, on-demand HIV and health-related information, and medication and appointment reminders.  Another component of mHealth is My Community, a set of interactive websites and Facebook pages that offers electronically-mapped service locations and downloadable referrals, HIV and related news and information, individual risk screening, and more.

Cambodias achievements in preventing and treating HIV are a testament to the strong leadership and strategic direction of the Ministry of Health and other key government agencies as well as to the support of NGO and development partners.  The United States is proud to support Cambodia as it continues to work towards the goal of eliminating all new HIV infections by 2020.

Each year, #WorldMalariaDay provides an opportunity to recognize global efforts to eliminate malaria. The United States provides $4.5 million annually to the Control and Prevention of Malaria Project (CAP Malaria) - funded by USAID  through the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) - to fight #malaria in #Cambodia. How does this help?
 
In FY2015, USAID Cambodia procured and distributed more than 122,000 mosquito nets to at-risk populations. Village malaria workers made over 143,000 visits to households and over 22,000 visits to development farms to educate people about malaria prevention. And after training more than 900 health facility and community workers in case management, close to 26,000 patients were confirmed malaria positive and received proper treatment.

To eliminate malaria in Cambodia by 2025, USAID is working with the National Malaria Program Center to pilot a malaria elimination intervention package, with the hope that it will one day serve as the basis for a model that can be replicated throughout the country.

  - From the Ambassador's Penh

As I begin this final entry to my blog, I would first like to say thanks to all of the people of this great nation.  It has been both an honor and a privilege to spend these last three years serving as the U.S. Ambassador to the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia.  I especially appreciate all of the comments and questions that you have shared with me.  I think back to my very first blog entry in June 2012, when I stated that my top goal was to foster a more effective relationship between the people of the United States and Cambodia.  Today, I am proud to say that there has been significant progress made because of the contributions and dedication of civil society members.  Their efforts have encouraged a growing number of people to play an active role in the development of Cambodia.

Over the course of more than three years in Cambodia, I have been fortunate to have met with and learned from several wonderful and dedicated individuals who are making a difference in the lives of the Cambodian people.  When I think about what has already been achieved and the challenges that lie ahead, the efforts of these men and women make me very hopeful.  Many of these individuals are a part of Cambodias vibrant civil society.  In fact, frequent readers of my blog know that I have often written about the amazing work of civil society and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), since much of Cambodias success in recent years  a growing economy, improvements in health care and schools, a greater focus on human rights, and more  is due in great part to the work of civil society leaders and organizations.

Many readers of my blog would often ask me about my thoughts regarding the role of NGOs and civil society in Cambodia.  No matter if it is Cambodia, the United States, or any other nation  I firmly believe that when civil society is strong, the country is stronger.  I also think that any effort to restrict the freedoms of assembly and expression is not conducive towards a healthy and sustainable democracy.  With the Royal Government providing the space for NGOs to operate freely, civil society was able to make significant contributions to the electoral process and built voter confidence during the 2013 national elections.  It is my hope that government and civil society leaders will continue to work together to promote democracy, protect human rights, and bring prosperity to all citizens of Cambodia.

History shows that government alone cannot deliver social and economic progress that is broad-based and sustainable.  A thriving civil society is needed to empower citizens, to find innovative solutions to challenges, and to hold government leaders accountable.  Furthermore, when there is limited government funding for public services, civil society helps to fill important gaps, especially for people living in under-served communities.  Here in Cambodia, there have already been many achievements in the areas of health, nutrition, education, environmental protection, and community development due to the efforts of the NGO community.  With the sustained presence of effective programs and partnerships with civil society, there is potential to help Cambodia reach even greater heights.

Not long after arriving to Cambodia, I invited a number of representatives from civil society to be a part of my NGO Advisory Council.  The Council proved to be an effective avenue for engaging with Cambodian civil society directly on a wide range of important topics, including the role that U.S. government programs and policies play in addressing some of the leading challenges in Cambodia.  I would like to thank all of the members of the NGO Advisory Council for providing me with your expertise and advice these past three years.  We have had some excellent and very frank discussions together, which has helped me and my U.S. Embassy team to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Cambodia. 

In the United States, many people use the expression staying the course, which means to pursue a goal regardless of time, obstacles, or criticism.  As Cambodia moves forward, I encourage members of civil society to stay the course and continue improving the quality of life for the Cambodian people.  By working together with the Royal Government, the private sector, and other partners found in the region and around the world, Cambodias civil society will continue to help lead the country towards achieving all of its development goals.

I want to again thank everyone for your support during my time in Cambodia.  I look forward to hearing about even greater success in the future.  May God bless each of you and your families, may God bless the Royal Kingdom of Cambodia, and may God bless the United States of America.

The high volume of traffic continues to increase, and yet the city lacks an efficient traffic management system.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Atlanta, Georgia

4:01 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Please be seated.  I want to thank Dr. Frieden and everybody here at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for welcoming me here today.  Tom and his team just gave me an update on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, our efforts to help mobilize the international community to fight it, and the steps that were taking to keep people here at home safe. 

Tom and his team are doing outstanding work.  Between the specialists they have on the ground in West Africa and here at headquarters, theyve got hundreds of professionals who are working tirelessly on this issue.  This is the largest international response in the history of the CDC.  After this, Ill be meeting with some of these men and women, including some who recently returned from the front lines of the outbreak.  And they represent public service at its very best.  And so I just want them to know how much the American people appreciate them.  Many of them are serving far away from home, away from their families.  They are doing heroic work and serving in some unbelievably challenging conditions -- working through exhaustion, day and night, and many have volunteered to go back.  So we are very, very proud of them.

Their work and our efforts across the government is an example of what happens when America leads in confronting some major global challenges.  Faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to us, the United States, and its a responsibility that we embrace.  Were prepared to take leadership on this to provide the kinds of capabilities that only America has, and to mobilize the world in ways that only America can do.  Thats what were doing as we speak. 

First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.  Weve been taking the necessary precautions, including working with countries in West Africa to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus doesnt get on a plane for the United States.  In the unlikely event that someone with Ebola does reach our shores, weve taken new measures so that were prepared here at home.  Were working to help flight crews identify people who are sick, and more labs across our country now have the capacity to quickly test for the virus.  Were working with hospitals to make sure that they are prepared, and to ensure that our doctors, our nurses and our medical staff are trained, are ready, and are able to deal with a possible case safely.

And here Ive got to commend everybody at Emory University Hospital.  I just had the opportunity to meet with Doctors Gartland and Ribner and members of their team and the nurses who -- sorry, doctors, but having been in hospitals, I know -- (laughter) -- theyre the ones really doing the work.  And I had a chance to thank them for their extraordinary efforts in helping to provide care for the first Americans who recently contracted the disease in Africa.  The first two of those patients were released last month and continue to improve.  And its a reminder for the American people that, should any cases appear in the United States, we have world-class facilities and professionals ready to respond.  And we have effective surveillance mechanisms in place.  

I should mention, by the way, that I had a chance to see Dr. Brantly in the Oval Office this morning.  And although he is still having to gain back some weight, he looks great.  He looks strong and we are incredibly grateful to him and his family for the service that he has rendered to people who are a lot less lucky than all of us.

As we all know, however, West Africa is facing a very different situation, especially in the hardest hit countries:  Liberia, Sierra Leone, and in Guinea.  Tom and others recently returned from the region, and the scenes that they describe are just horrific.  More than 2,400 men, women and children are known to have died -- and we strongly suspect that the actual death toll is higher than that.  Hospitals, clinics and the few treatment centers that do exist have been completely overwhelmed.  An already very weak public health system is near collapse in these countries.  Patients are being turned away, and people are literally dying in the streets.

Now, heres the hard truth:  In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before.  Its spiraling out of control.  It is getting worse.  Its spreading faster and exponentially.  Today, thousands of people in West Africa are infected.  That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands.  And if the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us.  So this is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security -- its a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.  That has profound effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the disease.

And thats why, two months ago, I directed my team to make this a national security priority.  Were working this across our entire government, which is why today Im joined by leaders throughout my administration, including from my national security team. 

And weve devoted significant resources in support of our strategy with four goals in mind.  Number one, to control the outbreak.  Number two, to address the ripple effects of local economies and communities to prevent a truly massive humanitarian disaster.  Number three, to coordinate a broader global response.  And number four, to urgently build up a public health system in these countries for the future -- not just in West Africa but in countries that dont have a lot of resources generally.

Now, this is a daunting task.  But heres what gives us hope.  The world knows how to fight this disease.  Its not a mystery.  We know the science.  We know how to prevent it from spreading.  We know how to care for those who contract it.  We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives.  But we have to act fast.  We cant dawdle on this one.  We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we had not seen before.   

So today, Im announcing a major increase in our response.  At the request of the Liberian government, were going to establish a military command center in Liberia to support civilian efforts across the region -- similar to our response after the Haiti earthquake.  Its going to be commanded by Major General Darryl Williams, commander of our Army forces in Africa.  He just arrived today and is now on the ground in Liberia.  And our forces are going to bring their expertise in command and control, in logistics, in engineering.  And our Department of Defense is better at that, our Armed Services are better at that than any organization on Earth. 

Were going to create an air bridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster.  Were going to establish a staging area in Senegal to help distribute personnel and aid on the ground more quickly.  We are going to create a new training site to train thousands of health workers so they can effectively and safely care for more patients.  Personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service will deploy to the new field hospitals that were setting up in Liberia.  And USAID will join with international partners and local communities in a Community Care Campaign to distribute supplies and information kits to hundreds of thousands of families so they can better protect themselves. 

Were also going to build additional treatment units, including new isolation spaces and more than 1,000 beds.  And in all our efforts, the safety of our personnel will remain a top priority.  Meanwhile, our scientists continue their urgent research in the hope of finding new treatments and perhaps vaccines.  And today Im calling on Congress to approve the funding that weve requested so that we can carry on with all these critical efforts.     

Today, the United States is doing even more.  But this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response.  International organizations just have to move faster than they have up until this point.  More nations need to contribute experienced personnel, supplies, and funding thats needed, and they need to deliver on what they pledge quickly.  Charities and individual philanthropists have given generously, and they can make a big difference.  And so were not restricting these efforts to governmental organizations; we also need NGOs and private philanthropies to work with us in a coordinated fashion in order to maximize the impact of our response. 

This week, the United States will chair an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.  Next week, Ill join U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to continue mobilizing the international community around this effort.  And then, at the White House, were going to bring more nations together to strengthen our global health security so that we can better prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. 

This is actually something that we had announced several months ago at the G7 meeting.  We determined that this has to be a top priority; this was before the Ebola outbreak.  We anticipated the fact that in many of these countries with a weak public health system, if we dont have more effective surveillance, more effective facilities on the ground, and are not helping poor countries in developing their ability to catch these things quickly, that there was at least the potential of seeing these kinds of outbreaks.  And sadly, we now see that our predictions were correct.  It gives more urgency to this effort -- a global health initiative -- that we have been pushing internationally.    

Let me just close by saying this:  The scenes that were witnessing in West Africa today are absolutely gut-wrenching.  In one account over the weekend, we read about a family in Liberia.  The disease had already killed the father.  The mother was cradling a sick and listless five-year-old son.  Her other son, 10-years-old, was dying, too.  They finally reached a treatment center but they couldnt get in.  And, said a relative, We are just sitting. 

These men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die, right now.  And it doesnt have to be this way.     

The reality is that this epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better.  But right now, the world still has an opportunity to save countless lives.  Right now, the world has the responsibility to act -- to step up, and to do more.  The United States of America intends to do more.  We are going to keep leading in this effort.  Were going to do our part, and were going to continue to make sure that the world understands the need for them to step alongside us as well in order for us to not just save the lives of families like the one I just discussed, but ultimately, to make sure that this doesnt have the kinds of spillover effects that become even more difficult to control.

So thank you very much to the entire team thats already doing this work.  And please know that youve got your President and Commander-in-Chief behind you.  Thank you.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

In my role as the U.S. Ambassador, I get the chance to travel across Cambodia and meet with amazing people making significant contributions to the countrys development.  As many readers of my blog have learned, I believe that one of the most critical aspects of Cambodias future growth is the education of its children.  Making sure that every child in Cambodia has access to a quality education will help children to fulfill their potential and help the country develop economically.  This is why I was delighted to have the opportunity to visit the LaValla School last week, as it is a remarkable example of an organization that is committed to the education of all children, including those with physical disabilities.

Located in Takhmao, Kandal Province, the LaValla School was established by the Marist Brothers in 1998 to provide a residential elementary program for children with physical disabilities.  In fact, it is the only school that the Royal Cambodian government has approved to provide full primary education to children with physical disabilities.  There are approximately 100 students currently attending the school and about 35 percent of the students are girls.  In addition to their approved and accelerated curriculum, the LaValla School also offers extended learning programs, which include English language, traditional Khmer music, basic computing skills, physical and hydro-therapy, and more.  Furthermore, the school works as a resource center to prepare children from low-income families for future integration into regular schools.

When I arrived at LaValla, I was kindly greeted by Brother Terry Heinrich and other members of the school management team.  Brother Terry has been living in Cambodia since 1997 and works with Marist Solidarity Cambodia, an international NGO that promotes empowerment and advocacy, and provides referral services for appropriate rehabilitation, education, vocational training and livelihood and employment opportunities to the children and youth with disabilities.  After meeting the staff, I had the opportunity to tour the school facilities, participate in an inauguration ceremony for a new boys dormitory, watch a music performance, and speak with the students.  It was important to let them know about the unique opportunity that they are receiving at the LaValla School.  With a good education and support from caring people like those at LaValla, these young people will have a better chance to succeed and help improve the lives of others as well.

In addition to the youth studying at LaValla, the school also supports another 400 children with disabilities throughout the country.  Most of the schools funding comes from the Grapes for Humanity Global Foundation (GHGF).  During my visit to LaValla, I met GHGF founder and director Ms. Arlene Willis and members of the Foundations board.  Along with the work they are doing at LaValla, GHGF also received funding from the U.S. government for a public-private partnership on humanitarian mine action.  Recently, the Foundation was able to raise $100,000 for Cambodian survivors of landmine and unexploded ordinance accidents.  These funds will be granted to the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation to construct new rehabilitation facilities in Prey Veng.

I would like to thank everyone at the LaValla School for the kind invitation and warm welcome during my visit.  I had a wonderful time speaking with the youth, teachers, and staff.  The commitment and the hard work that I witnessed will keep me and others hopeful about the future.  I have no doubt that the LaValla School and its students will have a powerful and positive impact on the development of Cambodia, proving that a quality education can bring success to all.

A SPECIAL JULY 4TH MESSAGE FROM AMBASSADOR HEIDT
(as seen in The Phnom Penh Post)

On November 8, the American people will come together to select a new President of the United States, along with thousands of other federal, state, and local ofcials. This years election is shaping up to be one of the most hotly contested in our history, with strong views on both sides. 

Despite the rhetoric and passion of the election, no matter who wins, the fundamental principles of our democracy will remain intact. The winners will celebrate, the losers will concede, and the decision of the American people will be respected, as it has been for more than two centuries. The candidates and the political parties will put the election behind them. The winners will get on with the business of governing; the losers will start getting ready for the next election.  

There is more than one recipe for democracy. What works for the United States may not necessarily work for Cambodia. But in any democracy, political forces must share a basic acceptance that their opponents have a legitimate right to engage in politics.  Politicians from all sides may not agree on the issues, or even like each other, but they must accept that their opponents have the right to advocate for their interests, and treat them accordingly.  

I have gotten to know many of the leaders of the government and opposition since I returned to Cambodia nine months ago. By and large, they are good and patriotic people trying to do their best for Cambodia. But neither side seems to accept the other as legitimate. Little more than a year after the Culture of Dialogue was announced, once again I see little respect or polite discourse in contemporary Cambodian politics. When it comes to accepting the right of your opponent to pursue his interests  the essence of reconciliation  I feel saddened to say that there has been little progress on either side since my previous assignment here in the late 1990s.

If Cambodian democracy is going to endure, as the Cambodian people clearly want, politicians from all sides need to separate the political from the personal. They need to understand that two sides can disagree about the direction of the nation while sharing a love for the country, its citizens, and its institutions. They need, above all, to recognize the good in each other.

There is a fundamental difference between disagreeing with your opponent and considering him or her to be an enemy. Politicians in the United States have radically different points of view on every issue imaginable. But our best politicians  our statesmen and stateswomen  respect their opponents right to pursue their interests and compete in elections. They know that calling each other traitors, or challenging each others patriotism, cheapen our politics.

In all honesty, it has not always been that way. In the early part of our history our politicians often engaged in stghts and worse, and it took many years of bitter politics for them to realize that this was counter-productive to their interests, and the interests of the nation.

Since arriving in Cambodia as the U.S. Ambassador last September, I have been amazed with the progress that this country has made since the 1990s. The economy is booming, the infra-structure is more developed, the people are healthier and more educated, and civil society is stronger. Cambodias youth are optimistic, proud of their country, and eager to participate in shaping its future. Cambodia has overcome many obstacles over the years, but the inability of Cambodias political leaders to work with each other for the benet of the nation continues to prevent this great country from reaching its full potential. 

On July 4, we will celebrate the 240th anniversary of the independence of the United States of America. We have been through many ups and downs over the years, but over time our democracy has not just survived but ourished. The work of democracy is never nished, but we are making progress. As a friend of Cambodia, it is my earnest hope that both the government and opposition can reach out to each other in a spirit of patriotism and reconciliation to do the same.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Scientists have recently confirmed that 2014 was the warmest year since 1880, and 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred this century.  Closer to home, researchers expect that Cambodia will experience increases in average temperature, a longer and warmer dry season, and more rainfall during the wet season.  The variation in the weather also includes the recent cold snap we experienced over the past month here, with temperatures dropping to the low teens in some areas and the government advising people to bundle up in warmer clothing as a preventive measure against colds, influenza, and other respiratory illnesses associated with cold weather.  All of these variations are the result of climate change.

Whether in Phnom Penh or traveling to other parts of the country, I have seen Cambodians dealing with the effects of climate change.  We experienced some of the coolest temperatures that I have felt since my time in Cambodia.  However, a different day or a different part of the country will bring large amounts of dust and dry temperatures.  Along with having an impact on our individual sense of comfort and clothing preferences, these changes have a noticeable effect on Cambodias most important resources.

Last week, I had the opportunity to visit a number of rural areas in Cambodia, where approximately 80 percent of the population lives.  The people I met rely on agriculture, fisheries, and forestry for their livelihoods.  Agriculture, in particular, is one of the pillars to Cambodias economic growth.  However, scientists and economists note the countrys vulnerability to climate change, which can lead to lower agricultural output and greater food insecurity for millions of Cambodians.  Shifts in rainfall and flooding patterns resulting from climate change threaten traditional agricultural production, which accounts for 85 percent of all rice production in the country.

I have also visited the Cardamom Mountains, the largest tropical moist broadleaf forest in Southeast Asia and home to a vast population of plant and animal life.  You can already see the huge impact that climate change is having in the area.  Adding to the damage that has been caused by cutting down too many trees, changes in Cambodias weather have started to create problems for trees in the rainforest.  The continued loss of trees could result in limited food security, dust storms, droughts, record flooding throughout the year, and extreme temperatures that can be especially dangerous.
 
Newly released maps help show that Cambodia continues to suffer major deforestation.  The loss of forest cover magnifies the impact of climate change by altering the water supply and leading to intensified floods and droughts.  It is important to remember that Cambodias precious forests not only provide livelihoods for many Cambodians, but the forests ability to hold carbon helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the entire world, further helping to combat global climate change.

Several U.S. government initiatives help Cambodias farmers adapt to challenges caused by changing weather patterns.  Cambodia HARVEST, an integrated food security and climate change program, is helping thousands of farmers increase their income, improve food security, and adapt to the consequences of climate change.  As part of its work with rice farmers, HARVEST introduced flood- and drought-tolerant seed varieties that allow farmers to delay or accelerate planting according to unpredictable weather conditions.  I have visited several HARVEST-supported farms, and it has been gratifying to see how the program helps farmers and their families boost their standard of living by evening out crop production.

In his State of the Union Address this week, President Barack Obama said, And no challenge  no challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.  I strongly believe that, working together, the United States and Cambodia can do much to address climate change and its threat to the countrys agricultural productivity and food security.

""It is beautiful to see how unique culture, accent, identity, people and food each city has. New Orleans, Louisiana is my most favorite city so far, probably because things went pretty smoothly as planned. In the morning, we made a visit to New Orleans Mission, a shelter for the homeless and the needy, to donate 40,000 pounds of chicken sponsored by Tyson Foods.  
After visiting New Orleans Mission, we met with Mayor of New Orleans to talk about the community innovation in New Orleans and how New Orleans was rebuilt after the effect of hurricane Katrina.    
After all, it was a very productive day. I met with and talked to five influential women in technology. Here is why I think storytelling is so powerful in empowering people who want to walk the same path, those people always left me feel so inspired every time after listening to their stories. Therefore, I hope their stories will reach out to other young girls and women out to be as passionate as they are. After the interview, with other millennials and mentors on the train we went to Frenchmen Street to get the true taste of New Orleans. Frenchmen street is one of the best known places for the citys popular live music, bars, coffee shops and night market. I had a great time in New Orleans. I will definitely come back to New Orleans one day before returning to my country.""

The relationship between Golden West and the Kingdom of Cambodia is making a significant contribution to the welfare of Cambodias citizens by delivering innovative solutions to organizations that remove mines before accidents occur.  The U.S. State Department is proud to be a financial supporter of Golden Wests work in Cambodia.  The U.S. government is the worlds largest single financial supporter of efforts to clear landmines and unexploded ordinance, with more than $2.1 billion in assistance since 1993.  

DCM Chung highlighted the human cost of unexploded ordinance (UXO), saying that,  Accidents from mines not only leave physical and emotional scars on a Cambodian family  they render land unusable.  If there was a blast in a farmers field, then that plot of land wont produce at the next harvest, and if the blast occurred on a dirt road used by villagers in the dry season to take goods to market, then those people will lose time and money taking a longer route.  

The United States has invested more than $61 million in demining and UXO clearance operations in Cambodia over the past 20 years, including by providing the Royal Government of Cambodia with mine detection technologies and training on the disposal of explosives.  Cambodia is sharing its knowledge in the field joining UN Peacekeeping Operations in Africa and using its demining expertise to assist other countries in need.

(Photo: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry poses for a photo with a Cambodian woman wearing the traditional sampot before he delivered remarks at the US-ASEAN Business Council 30th Anniversary Event in Washington, D.C October 2, 2014)

As we celebrate International Day of the Girl, I congratulate Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan who has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  As a recipient of one of the worlds highest honors, Malalas resilience and courage challenge us all to support the struggle against brutality, ignorance, and violence.  She inspires hope in millions of people and embodies our commitment to human rights and education. 

International Day of the Girl reminds us of the need to recommit to investing in the worlds 850 million girls so that they can use their talents to contribute to their communities and countries.  Every year of schooling increases a girls individual earning power by 10 to 20 percent, and the return on secondary education is even higher.  Adolescent girls who attend secondary school will marry later, raise fewer but healthier children, and be less likely to be infected by HIV/AIDS.  Countries with higher levels of female secondary school enrollment have lower infant mortality rates, lower birth rates, lower rates of HIV/AIDS, and better child nutrition.  Each additional year of a mothers secondary schooling reduces the probability of infant mortality by 510 percent, and a child born to a mother who can read is 50 percent more likely to live past age five. 

Unfortunately, we live in a world where girls are often not valued.   Today, 250 million girls live in poverty, one in three girls in the developing world will be married before turning 18, and 62 million girls are out of school--deprived of an education that would lead to positive health and economic outcomes. Worldwide, an estimated 150 million girls have experienced sexual violence, and nearly half of all sexual assaults are committed against girls younger than 16 years of age.  In 2013, nearly 80 percent of all new HIV infections among those ages 15 to 24 affected adolescent girls and young women.  Thus, the consequences of failing to adequately invest in girls are enormous. 

The United States understands that when a girl is kept from achieving her potential it is a loss not only for that individual girl, but also for her family, community, and country.  We know that empowering girls, keeping them free from violence, and providing them with an education is one of the best ways to ensure that societies thrive.  Nowhere is this more true than in Afghanistan where women and girls have persevered despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles, and made incredible gains over the past 13 years to help put their country on the path to peace, prosperity, and security.  

We must involve elders, faith leaders, educators, and influential community figures in this effort. Governments must educate their citizens about the correlation between investing in programs for girls and the benefits to society, and hold accountable those individuals responsible for acts of violence and oppression.  Make no mistake, educated girls, empowered with knowledge, are the best rebuke against the brutal forces of violent extremism.

It is not a coincidence that girls and women are targeted by these groups like ISIL and Boko Haram.  We must stand against those extremists groups that have arbitrarily targeted women and girls and subjected them to sexual violence and forced marriage.  Their plight underscores the challenges we face to ensure girls grow up in a world where every girl lives a life of dignity, free from violence.

By working together as a community of nations, we can build a world in which girls are not treated as property, chattel, or spoils of war, but rather as individuals with their own voice, talents, and freedom to realize their potential and contribute to our collective humanity. This is the message Malala has taught us, and this is the message of progress and justice.",2014-10-15,12.0

-From the Ambassador's Penh

If you are a regular reader of my blog, you know that children and family are very important to me.  Family is the most basic building block of any society.  Keeping families together and raising healthy children is a priority for me.  Thats why I was so happy to spend some time last week with my friends at the Cambodian Childrens Fund (CCF).  Since I first learned about CCF and saw their work first hand, Ive followed the work they do to help families in Phnom Penh.  Founded in 2004, Cambodian Childrens Fund helps vulnerable children and their families from some of Cambodias most destitute communities.  In the beginning, CCFs work revolved around the health and well-being of many children working at the highly toxic Steung Meanchey landfill in Phnom Penh that is now closed.  Today, CCF cares for more than 2,000 students and has extended its services to help entire families and communities meet their needs for childcare, health care, counseling, and even job training.

As a father, the welfare and happiness of my children is something I think about every day.  Their nutrition, their education, and their place in their community  these are the priorities that led me to make many of the most important decisions of my life.  In Cambodia, too many parents are faced with impossible choices.  Should they send their children to school or have them work so that the family has enough to eat?  Should they pay for the medicine that their kids need or the school books for their education?  Should they buy better seed for their rice paddy or shoes for their children?

Some families are forced to leave their children in institutions, because they feel they are unable to provide them the care they need at home.  These are choices that families should never have to make.  My visit to CCF reminded me that a helping hand is often enough to change this equation.  By helping families provide their children with good education, nutrition, and protection from harm  we can keep families together and help children become healthy, active, and productive citizens.

This was made even clearer to me when I visited the Rice Academy  a school run by CCF and funded by the generous donations of John and Cammie Rice.  The kids I met were enthusiastic, energetic, and eager to learn.  I have a feeling we are going to see great things from these children.

As I mentioned at the start of this blog, keeping Cambodian families together is a priority for me.  In fact, the U.S. government is collaborating with the Cambodian government, NGOs, development partners, and the private sector this week to design a special initiative that will improve the lives of children who are living outside of family care and to prevent avoidable family-child separation.  The Family Care First initiative reflects President Obamas recognition of the importance of families to the well-being and growth of children. 

Family Care First will not only complement the work of CCF, but that of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and Youth Rehabilitation as well as our partners like Friends International who recently launched a very creative information campaign called the Keep Families Together, which is aimed at discouraging Cambodian families from placing their children into orphanages, by highlighting how they can access appropriate support to enable them to keep their children with them.

Whether its an organization like CCF or individuals like John and Cammie Rice  we all have a role to play in helping todays Cambodian children become tomorrows leaders.  Keeping families together is a great way of doing that.

#WorldHumanitarianDay was celebrated last week  when aid-worker heroes  who help and advocate for millions of people affected by crises around the world are honored.  Two active humanitarian forces in Cambodia today are #USAID and the U.S. Navy #Seabees.

In 24 years of operation USAID Cambodia has provided over $1 billion in assistance to the Cambodian people, much of it in humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance to meet the basic needs of Cambodians.

Since 2008, the Seabees have constructed water wells, clinics, and other modern facilities throughout Cambodia. They also provide basic life support (BLS) training on proper sanitation and hygiene, snake bites, and basic stitching methods. Over the next three years the Seabees will construct new facilities throughout six provinces, serving more than 77,000 people in over 90 villages.

For me, the highlight of President Obamas trip was his address at a town hall event in Burma on Friday, where he announced the creation of 500 short-term academic and professional exchanges to the United States through the Young Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative (YSEALI).  Two Cambodian YSEALI members  Hazan Illyasak and Huot Sok Im  were selected to travel to Burma to attend a workshop and to participate in this town hall.

I encourage all Cambodians between the ages of 18 and 35 to follow in the footsteps of Illyasak and Huot Sok and to become YSEALI members, where you can network with young leaders from the region, share experiences, and engage with experts from the United States.

Education can be your gateway to adventure!  Through the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program (Global UGRAD) outstanding undergraduate students receive semester and year-long scholarships to enroll in full-time non-degree study at a U.S. university.  Courses taken during the program are combined with community service, internships, and cultural enrichment opportunities.  The announcement for 2015 program applicants will be coming soon.  

This year, Uk Sovannara attended Florida Gulf Coast University on the Global UGRAD program.  Of his experience he said:

My life journey in the U.S left a glorious, indelible mark. It was an adventure of a lifetime which provided me unique and priceless experiences.  Over the course of some 4 months, Ive gained tremendous experience through deep and meaningful engagement with socially good and cultural activities both on and off campus. I attended an engineering club, conferences, workshops, and educational excursions offered by my university.  In addition, this program allowed me to explore the land. Ive been to many places, participated in multiple different fun activities, and met hundreds of people from different corners of the world, some of whom have become my closest friends. The impact of UGRAD on my life is profound, shaping my perspective on the world and how I behave in the society. Although I have completed the program, I still can reap the ongoing benefits from it by keeping in touch with the local U.S Embassy and the Fulbright and Undergraduate State Alumni Association of Cambodia (FUSAAC). I am also encouraged to share my experience and apply lessons I have learned from my U.S exchange program with young, enthusiastic Cambodian students across the country. Global UGRAD is an agent of change for the better.

July 25, 2015

The United States is closely monitoring the case of the 11 CNRP activists convicted of insurrection arising out of July 2014 protests in Phnom Penh.  Peaceful protest and freedom of expression are fundamental aspects of democracy.
    
The group, which includes U.S. citizen Meach Sovannara, was summarily convicted and received sentences that many feel are inappropriate.  The Department of State takes its assistance abroad to U.S. citizens very seriously.  A consular officer visited with Mr. Sovannara on Friday, July 24.  We will continue to provide all possible consular assistance.

The United States is deeply concerned by the process leading to these convictions.  We urge the Cambodian government to carefully review its judicial processes to ensure that they are complete and transparent and in accordance with domestic law and international norms.

During remarks at a ceremony to launch the report, Secretary of State John Kerry singled out the story of a Cambodian named Lang Long, who was rescued after being forced into slavery on a fishing vessel. Lang Long represents the 20 million people around the world who continue to be victims of Trafficking in Persons.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

On December 10, the world lost a powerful voice for human rights in Cambodia with the sudden and unexpected death of Chan Soveth, who was a senior investigator for the human rights NGO ADHOC.  As many Cambodians already know, Soveth died of a heart attack after returning home from a Human Rights Day event.  He is survived by his wife and three children.

Although he died much too soon, at age 51, Soveth leaves behind a legacy that should make his family and nation proud.  Soveths primary work was to compile investigation reports on suspected human rights violations, with a focus on land disputes.  He helped to shed light cases that might otherwise have gone unnoticed by the human rights community.  Soveth didnt just bring attention to problems  he looked for solutions.  For instance, he took the lead in establishing a dialogue with the Cambodian Human Rights Committee, which led to a new found cooperation between the government and NGOs on the investigation of human rights violation cases.  

Like many of his generation, Soveth was orphaned during the Khmer Rouge regime and lived for a time as a refugee.  He was able to overcome adversity, to develop knowledge and expertise, and ultimately to find his lifes work as a human rights investigator.  Soveth worked tirelessly  day or night, weekday or weekend.  Soveth worked in some of the most remote parts of the country, and he never backed down in the face of threats and intimidation.  He always put the needs of the Cambodian people ahead of his own personal safety and comfort.  

To me, Soveths story demonstrates that one person really can bring about positive change through hard work, dedication, and persistence.  It also shows that you dont have to be famous to make a difference.  Soveth may have worked behind the scenes for most of his career, but his work has had a positive impact on many thousands of Cambodians.  Although he is no longer with us, my hope is that Soveths life will serve as an inspiration to present and future human rights defenders, both in Cambodia and throughout the world.  He has certainly been a great inspiration to me.  He will be missed.

The Department of State is updating the Worldwide Caution to provide information on the continuing threat of terrorist actions and violence against U.S. citizens and interests throughout the world. U.S. citizens are reminded to maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. This replaces the Worldwide Caution dated April 10, 2014.

The Department of State remains concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks, demonstrations, and other violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests overseas. On September 22, 2014, the United States and regional partners commenced military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a designated  terrorist organization in Syria and Iraq. In response to the airstrikes, ISIL called on supporters to attack foreigners wherever they are. Authorities believe there is an increased likelihood of reprisal attacks against U.S., Western and coalition partner interests throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and Asia.

She stood up in front of me, the First Lady of Cambodia, and dozens of international reporters and camera crews, and let me tell you, she spoke so eloquently about her life.  She was poised and confident.  And this is what she told us.  She said -- and these are her words -- she said, I have been through a lot of hardships.  I know that I need to overcome them.

I do not think that women are appreciated enough in #Cambodia, even though we earn an income, have good education, and care for our children and husbands. Yes, it is hard to be a woman in this country...but we are very strong."" - Dr. Neou Leakhena

Dr. Leakhena knew from a young age that she wanted to work in pediatric medicine. Studying in Phnom Penh in the 1990s, she was one of only 17 women in her class of more than 100. After years of hard work and dedication, today Dr. Leakhena directs neonatal care at the Angkor Hospital for Children in Siem Reap, which receives support from the U.S. government for its vital work in pediatric HIV/AIDS treatment. She is among a growing number of Cambodian women that are working in the health sector - not only in the traditional roles of nurses or assistants - but also as doctors and healthcare administrators.

For example, the Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE in Phnom Penh - which trains medical professionals and provides free high quality care to the poor - also has several amazing female doctors on its staff. Pictured below are Dr. Huy Sophea, Dr. Uch Muzen, Dr. Soth Sotheary, Dr.Chhun Sreymao,  Dr. Heing Kosalthyda, and Dr. Say Sothea. They all agree that education is the key to success for women. As Dr. Sreymao says, ""If you dont want someone to look down at you as a woman, you should try to build your capacity and knowledge. When you have an education, no one can look down at you.

For my first blog post of March, I thought that it would be fitting to highlight the fact that this is Womens History Month in the United States. This is a time when Americans honor the many economic, political, and social achievements of women. And on March 8, the United States will join Cambodia and several countries around the world to celebrate International Womens Day. As my mothers son, my wifes husband, and my daughters father, I am blessed to have so many remarkable women in my family. In my time as U.S. Ambassador, I have seen that Cambodian women are also critically important to their families and to society. In recognition of all the great things women have accomplished  as well as the challenges they continue to face  the U.S. Embassy will utilize its multiple social media platforms this month to spotlight current individuals, organizations, and events that focus on women and girls in Cambodia. I would like to start this series with a valued U.S. Embassy partner: the Harpswell Foundation.
Founded by U.S. academic and humanitarian Alan Lightman, the Harpswell Foundation provides education, housing, and leadership training for young Cambodian women while they attend university. The organization is dedicated to improving the conditions of women and the societies they live in by promoting women's education, leadership, and empowerment. To support this mission, I have participated in a number of events at Harpswell, including last years inauguration of their Womens Empowerment Program. Last week, Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung had the opportunity to visit Harpswell and like me, she was very impressed with the young women that she met.

During her visit, Julie spoke about her own experiences as a woman, as an Asian American, and as an immigrant to the United States. Connecting with the young women on a personal level, she encouraged them to face the challenges of discrimination and achieve their dreams by having self-confidence, working hard, and demonstrating their capabilities through action. Sharing her story, she said, I was a backpacker student in Cambodia in 1996never did I imagine I would return to be the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy. So I say that one of you in this room can someday perhaps be Cambodias Ambassador to the United States. Young women like the ones at Harpswell are the future leaders of the country and are needed to help develop Cambodia into an even greater nation.

The experiences that Harpswell provides for young women have led to significant improvements in a number of areas, including public speaking, critical thinking skills, knowledge of national and international events, computer literacy, and English language ability. With these skills, Harpswell students have ranked at the top of their classes at several of the major universities in Cambodia. All of the young women that have graduated are now either studying for advanced degrees or currently employed. At least 20 of these alumni have received scholarships for post-graduate study in the United States and many others are completing masters degrees in Cambodia. Employed Harpswell alumni can be found in a wide variety of career fields, working as journalists, teachers, assistants in laws firms, project managers in NGOs, and financial consultants. Both the short-term and long-term accomplishments of these young women serve as evidence of Harpswells impact on the lives of young women and on Cambodias overall development.

The young women at Harpswell fill me and the members of my team with hope for the future of Cambodia. I would like to commend them for all of their hard work and say that no matter their backgrounds or hardships, they deserve the same opportunities as boys to accomplish what they want in life. The U.S. Embassy strongly supports the mission of the Harpswell Foundation. We look forward to further progress in our successful collaboration with this and other organizations that are dedicated to improving the lives of Cambodian girls.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I am happy to learn that more international companies are investing in Cambodia to build their business and create new jobs for Cambodians.  This investment is an important driver of trade, growth, and economic prosperity for the country.  Along with the creation of jobs, some companies are also committed to improving environmental and labor standards in Cambodia by the way they run their business.  In the past,  I have highlighted  examples of strong corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices in Cambodia, which are both good for the employees and good for business.  These include GEs contributions to supporting schools and medical equipment training as well as Tiffany & Co.s state-of-the-art diamond polishing factory that provides free medical care for its workers.

Last week, I had the opportunity to see firsthand another company that promotes both CSR and quality work standards in Cambodia.  Pactics, established in 2004, operates a factory in Siem Reap that employs 325 full-time Cambodian staff.  The company specializes in manufacturing microfiber bags and other accessories for sunglasses, jewelry, and electronics which it supplies for a number of U.S. companies such as eyeglass manufacturer Oakley.

During my tour, I learned how Pactics invested money to incorporate sustainable building measures and energy saving technology when designing its factory.  For example, windows are north-facing to provide natural light while reducing electricity usage by minimizing heat-generating direct sunlight.  Strategically placed vents create a naturally cool workspace, rainwater is collected to flush toilets, and solar panels power the LED lights used after dark.  General manager Boris Ploum explained that Pactics efforts to minimize its environmental impact may seem expensive but actually reduces operating costs over the long run.

The Cambodian government can encourage the use of green technologies by providing incentives to companies that invest in these technologies.  I commend the announcement of a recent proposal by Environment Minister Say Samal to make eco-friendly and green technologies tax-free to help reduce the cost barriers associated with importing green technologies, such as solar panels.

After touring the factory and meeting the workers, I appreciated more than ever the vision set by Pactics management to think beyond just profits to broader contributions they could make to the community.  The company also offers its employees fair wages, reasonable working hours, safe and clean working conditions, subsidies for motorbike helmets for a safe commute, and a full array of other benefits aimed to keep workers healthy.  Companies such as Pactics demonstrate that it is possible to run a successful business while caring for employees and the environment.  I encourage other companies in Cambodia to follow the example set by Pactics to improve working conditions for employees because it is not only the right thing to do; it is also good business.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Recently, many people in Cambodia have asked me about the Young Southeast Asia Leaders Initiative (#YSEALI), President Obamas signature program for promoting youth leadership and networking in the Southeast Asia region.  I was happy to describe to them the many opportunities YSEALI offers and highlight the events that Cambodians have participated in.  I have also encouraged young Cambodians to join YSEALI, not only to engage with their peers on key issues, but to harness their potential as the next generation of leaders in the region.

Here in Cambodia, YSEALI members have hosted a forum to discuss the future economic integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and participated in Embassy sponsored events, including a live viewing party for a speech by the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken and a live Twitter chat with Richard Stengel, the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.  These events provided YSEALI members with great opportunities to interact with senior U.S. government leaders and discuss a broad range of topics including democracy, tolerance, anti-corruption, and civic engagement.  In addition to these events, I shared in a previous blog that Cambodia also hosted YSEALI Generation: EARTH, a four-day regional exchange that helped foster a deeper understanding of climate change, deforestation, and other challenges to the environment facing the ASEAN region.

The YSEALI program also encourages promising youth leaders to carry out their own projects that improve their communities, countries, and the region through YSEALI Seeds for the Future, a small grants competition that provides funding of up to $20,000 for projects focusing on civic engagement, economic development, education, and environmental protection.  A select group of Cambodian YSEALI members, along with their counterparts from Thailand, recently organized a forum in Phnom Penh for more than 200 participants using a grant they won from last years YSEALI Seeds for the Future competition.  The forum was aimed at preparing Cambodian and Thai youth for the upcoming ASEAN economic integration and provided a platform for them to network and exchange ideas.  If you have an idea for a project, I encourage you to apply for the next round of YSEALI Seeds for the Future.  The deadline is June 15, 2015.

The YSEALI program has also given Cambodians the opportunity to travel abroad.  Six Cambodians  Muyheng Hong, Seila Sar, Suonvisal Seth, Se Chhin, Phalla Mey, and Sovanna Sek  spent six weeks in the United States through the YSEALI Professional Fellows Exchange program.  They participated in a hands-on fellowship to gain practical experience in leadership, education, environmental sustainability, and civic engagement.  To cap off their fellowship, they were among the 75 YSEALI Fellows from all 10 countries in ASEAN that were invited to the White House last week to meet with President Obama and share their experience in the United States.  In his remarks, President Obama recognized Suonvisal Seth for the good work he is doing in Cambodia.  In a press interview, Suonvisal said that he learned about good governance in the U.S. and plans to use his newfound knowledge to help develop Cambodia by improving the National Assemblys research department.  Suonvisal also said, I hope students here will see my trip as an impetus to work harder and get involved in more things.  I want to inspire Cambodian children to focus on advancing the countrys technology and leadership sectors.  If you want to make a difference like Suonvisal, you have the chance to apply for the YSEALI Professional Fellows program as well.  The deadline for this program is also June 15, 2015.  

From what Ive seen, Cambodian youth are clearly interested in engaging with their peers on the important issues that will determine the worlds future.  I firmly believe youth in Cambodia are embracing YSEALI to empower themselves to make a difference in their communities.  For example, weve received a significant number of applications for the YSEALI Professional Fellows program and the Seeds for the Future grant competition.  If you are not already a member of YSEALI and are between the ages of 18 and 35, I invite you to join this active and growing community.  To find out more about YSEALI and sign up for membership, go to https://youngsoutheastasianleaders.state.gov/

I want to recognize all the YSEALI members for the great work they are doing in Cambodia.  Please continue your efforts and tell me where YSEALI takes you.

A significant change in balloting in recent years has been the adoption of procedures that make ballots available to voters before the election.

This trend started with provisions for absentee ballots, issued to voters who anticipate being away from their home (and their voting place) on Election Day.

Another new provision is early voting, for which voting machines are set up in shopping malls and other public places for up to three weeks before Election Day.

Even though early ballots are becoming more popular, they are not counted until tabulation begins after the polls close, so that no official information can be released about which candidate is ahead or behind.

On Saturday, September 13, 2014, visiting Professor Eric Pallant accompanied the Cambodian Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) team members around Phnom Penh as part of a program to introduce the importance of maintaining clean water resources in Cambodia. 

In the morning, the YSEALI team escorted Professor Pallant to Pannasastra University of Cambodia where he gave a presentation to 80 university students on river rehabilitation and some of the simple steps each of us can do to help keep the rivers clean  including educating others, collecting rainwater and even some innovative agricultural practices.  There was a lively discussion after the presentation as the university students shared their perspectives and asked great questions. 

On the way to enjoy a good Cambodian lunch, the YSEALI team and Professor Pallant stopped to examine a small stream at Chroy Bassac, in Cambodias capital city Phnom Penh.  Professor Pallant used this opportunity to talk to the YSEALI group and some interested passers-by, about the challenges of cleaning up dirty water in densely populated areas like this part of Phnom Penh City.

After a satisfying lunch, the group went to the American Intercon Institute where a gathering of high school students and members of local non-government organizations (NGOs) were assembled to hear Professor Pallant speak.  The presentation again focused on the different methods to protect clean water and strategies to rehabilitate dirty rivers.  The students were very attentive and again asked great questions. 

Following the afternoon presentation, the YSEALI team and Professor Pallant went to examine a lake polluted by sewage water at the Beoung Tro Bek Water Pumping Station in Phnom Penh.  The site visit demonstrated, in very real terms, the need for action to care for Cambodias water resources.  

Professor Eric Pallant, Chair of the Environmental Science Department at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania, USA, is visiting Cambodia, the Philippines, and Vietnam to help the three-country YSEALI team with their Streams of Hope projects. Members from Cambodia, the Philippines, and Vietnam joined together to focus on maintaining clean water resources in the region.  As part of the U.S. Department of States Speaker Program, Professor Pallant will meet with high school and university students, members of civil society, government officials, and others who have a stake in maintaining clean water resources.

You can follow Professor Pallants trip throughout the region on Facebook.  He is in Cambodia until September 15, then he will be in Manila for three days where you can follow him on U.S. Embassy, Manila Philippines Facebook page, and then on to Hanoi for three days where you can follow him on the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi Facebook page.

By U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry
August 29, 2014

In a polarized region and a complicated world, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria presents a unifying threat to a broad array of countries, including the United States. Whats needed to confront its nihilistic vision and genocidal agenda is a global coalition using political, humanitarian, economic, law enforcement and intelligence tools to support military force.

In addition to its beheadings, crucifixions and other acts of sheer evil, which have killed thousands of innocents in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, including Sunni Muslims whose faith it purports to represent, ISIS (which the United States government calls ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) poses a threat well beyond the region.

ISIS has its origins in what was once known as Al Qaeda in Iraq, which has over a decade of experience in extremist violence. The group has amassed a hardened fighting force of committed jihadists with global ambitions, exploiting the conflict in Syria and sectarian tensions in Iraq. Its leaders have repeatedly threatened the United States, and in May an ISIS-associated terrorist shot and killed three people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels. (A fourth victim died 13 days later.) ISIS cadre of foreign fighters are a rising threat not just in the region, but anywhere they could manage to travel undetected -- including to America.

There is evidence that these extremists, if left unchecked, will not be satisfied at stopping with Syria and Iraq. They are larger and better funded in this new incarnation, using pirated oil, kidnapping and extortion to finance operations in Syria and Iraq. They are equipped with sophisticated heavy weapons looted from the battlefield. They have already demonstrated the ability to seize and hold more territory than any other terrorist organization, in a strategic region that borders Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and is perilously close to Israel. 

ISIS fighters have exhibited repulsive savagery and cruelty. Even as they butcher Shiite Muslims and Christians in their effort to touch off a broader ethnic and sectarian conflict, they pursue a calculated strategy of killing fellow Sunni Muslims to gain and hold territory. The beheading of an American journalist, James Foley, has shocked the conscience of the world.

With a united response led by the United States and the broadest possible coalition of nations, the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries. The world can confront this scourge, and ultimately defeat it. ISIS is odious, but not omnipotent. We have proof already in northern Iraq, where United States airstrikes have shifted the momentum of the fight, providing space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to go on the offensive. With our support, Iraqs leaders have come together to form a new, inclusive government that is essential to isolating ISIS and securing the support of all of Iraqs communities.

Airstrikes alone wont defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world. We need to support Iraqi forces and the moderate Syrian opposition, who are facing ISIS on the front lines. We need to disrupt and degrade ISIS capabilities and counter its extremist message in the media. And we need to strengthen our own defenses and cooperation in protecting our people.

Next week, on the sidelines of the NATO summit meeting in Wales, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and I will meet with our counterparts from our European allies. The goal is to enlist the broadest possible assistance. Following the meeting, Mr. Hagel and I plan to travel to the Middle East to develop more support for the coalition among the countries that are most directly threatened.

The United States will hold the presidency of the United Nations Security Council in September, and we will use that opportunity to continue to build a broad coalition and highlight the danger posed by foreign terrorist fighters, including those who have joined ISIS. During the General Assembly session, President Obama will lead a summit meeting of the Security Council to put forward a plan to deal with this collective threat.

In this battle, there is a role for almost every country. Some will provide military assistance, direct and indirect. Some will provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance for the millions who have been displaced and victimized across the region. Others will help restore not just shattered economies but broken trust among neighbors. This effort is underway in Iraq, where other countries have joined us in providing humanitarian aid, military assistance and support for an inclusive government.

Already our efforts have brought dozens of nations to this cause. Certainly there are different interests at play. But no decent country can support the horrors perpetrated by ISIS, and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to help stamp out this disease.  ISIS abhorrent tactics are uniting and rallying neighbors with traditionally conflicting interests to support Iraqs new government. And over time, this coalition can begin to address the underlying factors that fuel ISIS and other terrorist organizations with like-minded agendas.

Coalition building is hard work, but it is the best way to tackle a common enemy. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, the first President George Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III did not act alone or in haste. They methodically assembled a coalition of countries whose concerted action brought a quick victory. Extremists are defeated only when responsible nations and their peoples unite to oppose them.

You should  remain alert of local security developments by monitoring local news reports, exercising vigilance regarding your preparedness and personal security, remaining aware of your surroundings, and planning your activities accordingly.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

This week, I joined our Embassy community in bidding farewell to Dr. Claire Uebbing, MD, affectionately known by many of her patients and friends simply as Dr. Claire.  A board certified emergency medicine physician, she has completed three years of extraordinary service at the International SOS Clinic of Phnom Penh.  Now, she will be returning to the United States for more training and continue her career in emergency medicine.

Since August 2012, Dr. Claire has served as the de facto Emergency Room savior to members of our Mission, the U.S. military, American tourists, the expat community, and Cambodians as well.  In fact, Cambodians represent more than 60 percent of the patients that she has treated during her time in the country.  Her expertise and caring bedside manner  the relationship between doctor and patient  has made a huge difference in the lives of thousands of people.  Dr. Claire was always willing to adjust her schedule to accommodate her patients, even when she was busy with other tasks.  She has also served as a role model for her peers.

Like many other American doctors and nurses, Dr. Claire came to Cambodia due to her strong interest in helping people and practicing medicine abroad.  She has made a significant impact during her time in Cambodia, showing a commitment and genuine passion caring for patients and families with routine illnesses as well as severe medical crises.  Not only did she provide direct consultation and treatment, she was also able to reach people throughout the country by providing medical advice in newspapers, guide books, and online health resources.

Dr. Claire played a key role for the team at International SOS Cambodia.  Since establishing a medical clinic in Phnom Penh in 1998, the organization has served the needs of the public with help from both Cambodian doctors and international physicians like Dr. Claire.  The clinic specializes in a number of areas, including general practice, womens health, dermatology, internal medicine, emergency medicine, travel medicine and dental care.  While they will miss Dr. Claire, I am confident that their team will continue to provide quality services to people living and traveling in Cambodia.

In her advice to other health professionals, Dr. Claire says, Consciously seek out opportunities for you to experience medicine, in a clinical setting, as well as just volunteering at home and in the school community.  You know more about what you are getting into with this kind of experience.""  I am personally grateful that Dr. Claire decided to serve in Cambodia.  For all of us who have interacted and worked alongside her during these past three years, please join me in wishing her all the best as she pursues the next chapter in her life.  We sincerely thank Dr. Claire for her dedication to improving the lives of the Cambodian people, American citizens, and others who received her quality care.  She has truly made a difference that will be remembered.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I believe that entrepreneurs play a vital role in the development of a prosperous and dynamic society.  In the United States, innovators such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg generated ideas that have revolutionized technologies that we utilize globally.  They are internationally recognized and admired for nurturing their unique ideas into businesses and industries that have changed our lives and changed how we interact with one another. The creativity, drive, and determination that these and other entrepreneurs exhibit are the same qualities that I see in so many of the young Cambodians I talk to and work with. I firmly believe that their entrepreneurial energy and spirit are important keys to Cambodias future success.

This is why I was so delighted that Cambodian social entrepreneur and Young Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative (YSEALI) member Thul Rithy was able to participate in this years Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Morocco with the support of the U.S. Embassy.  Thul joined dozens of other young leaders from around the world for this event, held annually during Global Entrepreneurship Week.  The purpose of this summit is to bring a diverse group of entrepreneurs together with high-level government officials, corporate leaders, and small-medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to network, share experiences, and exchange ideas on a wide variety of topics.  

Here is what Thul had to say during his time in Morocco: Participating in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit was a great eye-opening and friendship-building experience with smart, good-hearted and beautiful people from around the world. I was very impressed with each individual's works in their respective communities. There have been many things that pop up in my head, but one thing that surely stays in there all the time is the idea of growing a strong start-up community in Cambodia.

Global Entrepreneurship Week aims to inspire and develop innovators and entrepreneurs through networking, mentorship, and business plan competitions. Celebrating its fifth year, this years summit theme  Harnessing the Power of Technology for Innovation and Entrepreneurship  emphasized the role that modern technology plays in fueling innovative concepts which build social capital, promote human development, and facilitate information exchange. More than 3,000 individuals from over 50 countries participated in interactive sessions that featured experienced entrepreneurs who started locally, scaled their business ideas, and created successful enterprises.  The summit included business plan competitions, an Innovation Village that allowed young entrepreneurs to network and find mentors, and a number of activities celebrating the achievements of women entrepreneurs.  Also speaking at the summit was U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who made it clear that a country can thrive when it fosters an environment that allows young people to become empowered through education and employment opportunities. 

The Vice President told the group, As the demographic wave of young people enters the labor force, it doesnt matter where you live if people cannot get educated; or they get educated and they cant get a job; or they get a job and cant earn a decent living; or they can earn a living, but it gets siphoned off or stolen by corruption; or if half the population women  cannot contribute to prosperity; those countries caught in that vortex are not positioned to succeed in the 21st century because real and lasting stability depends on governments and citizens finding a way to work together to expand opportunity and unlock the enormous talents of your people.

The U.S. Embassy continues to promote entrepreneurship as part of our efforts to help empower youth and expand Cambodias middle class.  Among other programs and initiatives, we have hosted a series of workshops and lectures at high schools and universities in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap that focused on the role that entrepreneurs play in solving problems and advancing progress in Cambodia.  Entrepreneurs help solve some of societys greatest challenges.  They design innovative solutions that raise productivity.  They start new businesses that create jobs.  These activities lead to economic growth, poverty reduction, and improvement in the quality of life for the citizens of Cambodia.  I will continue to lend my support and encourage ambitious and resourceful Cambodians like Thul Rithy, because many of these young Cambodians are destined to be future leaders and agents of change for the country and the world.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

In a previous blog post, I wrote about my good friend Mr. Youk Chhang, Director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) and a leading expert in compiling and preserving accurate records of the Khmer Rouge period.  For two decades, Youk has tirelessly worked to document Khmer Rouge atrocities while helping Cambodians reconcile with their past and move towards a brighter future.  With DC-Cam, he has established the worlds largest repository of documents and other original materials related to the Khmer Rouge era, contributing to research projects, education and outreach programs, and legal cases against the former Khmer Rouge leaders.  If you speak to Youk about his life and his work, you will become inspired by his compassion and his commitment to helping people.

Another testament to Youks dedication comes in the form of his recent discovery of more than 400 urns, known as kaod in the Khmer language.  While staying at Wat Langka last month to mourn the loss of his beloved sister, Youk came across a hidden door that had been blocked by a Buddha statue.  Entering into the room, he found a total of 464 urns made of stone, clay, silver, and bronze.  According to Youk, it is believed that the urns hold the remains of individuals from numerous families that the Khmer Rouge removed from Phnom Penh.  Prior to leaving the city, family members stored these valued possessions in Wat Langka, one of the few places they thought might be safe.  But in the years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, information about the location of the urns was lost.  Some of the urns that Youk came across are in glass boxes with photos or have labels showing the names of the deceased, while others are wrapped in decaying cloth or have labels that are barely legible.

Now, DC-Cam is determined to inform the public about this discovery, in order to help reunite the remains of loved ones with their respective family members.  In the meantime, the organization sought to remove the urns from where they were located and store them in a manner that would show respect to Cambodian families and traditions.  Contacting the U.S. Embassy to request assistance, DC-Cam was able to receive support from the U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NCMB), widely known as the Seabees.  As with Youk, I have also written posts in my blog about the commitment that has been demonstrated by the Seabees.  They have utilized their amazing engineering skills on a wide variety of projects in Cambodia, such as new health care facilities, community centers, water wells, bathroom facilities, and school classroom renovations.  So it comes to no surprise that when DC-Cam and members of Wat Langka needed a place to store, display, and quickly access the urns, the Seabees were there to answer the call. 

The Seabees from NCMB 5 are currently on a six-month deployment to Cambodia, focusing on two ongoing construction projects in Takeo Province.  However, a group of 23 Seabees took a short break from their assignment and came to Phnom Penh last week to build storage cabinets for the urns.  After two days of planning and construction, they completed five large cabinets that will serve to store all 464 urns securely.  Last Friday, the Seabees delivered and installed all five completed cabinets to Wat Langka.  Asked how it felt to be part of this unique project, one of the Seabees responded, It was an honor to be a part of history and help preserve part of the Cambodian peoples past for future generations.  Although it took a relatively short amount of time for them to build the shelves, it is clear that their work will have an impact not only on their lives, but also on the lives of the Cambodian people for years to come.

The Seabees of NCMB 5 uphold a strong tradition of community service by our U.S. military personnel, demonstrating remarkable professionalism and respect for all of those who benefit from their work.  I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to all of the Seabees for this as well as other important contributions they have made to Cambodia.  In working with DC-Cam to provide storage shelves for the urns, they help demonstrate the collaborative efforts the U.S. Embassy is proud to support.  I have great admiration for Youk Chhang and DC-Cam, as they have taken on the difficult yet important task of helping Cambodians make peace with the past and move towards a better future.  With the urns properly displayed and more accessible, there is now hope for more people coming to claim lost love ones.  Furthermore, this effort both honors the victims of the Khmer Rouge and protects the valuable lessons of history for future generations of Cambodians.

Nelson Mandela fought for the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunity.  He showed the world a noble path to equality and peace through reconciliation and forgiveness.  

Judging by the reaction of Cambodians to last weeks sad news, it is clear that Nelson Mandela was widely admired in Cambodia as a man of sacrifice and service who was committed to advancing human rights and democracy.  Several readers of this column expressed their admiration for his work, with one asking, How can we use the example that Nelson Mandela set to advance human rights in Cambodia?

-From the Ambassador's Penh

In the United States, the months of October and November are the best time to be a sports fan because all four major professional sports are in action.  The baseball World Series just finished, with the San Francisco Giants beating the underdog Kansas City Royals in an exciting elimination game.  The American football season is at the halfway point, and the basketball and hockey seasons are just beginning.  These sports arent so popular in Cambodia (although basketball is growing), but I invite you to learn more about them if you are interested in U.S. society and culture.

Professional and college sports for both men and women are very popular in the United States, but I am a big fan of amateur teams where people get together for fun and exercise.  In addition to the athletic element, sport is a great tool for building bridges between cultures and for creating friendships between people of different backgrounds.

Soccer (or football, as most people call it) is the worlds most popular sport.  I am excited that colleagues from the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh have joined together to create a U.S. Embassy soccer team, called Team USA.  Team USA is made up of U.S. and Cambodian employees of the U.S. Embassy who practice and play together.  The team represents the Embassys diversity:  players come from places like the Caribbean island of Dominica and Portland, Oregon, and they have jobs that range from shipping clerk to development specialists.  The players all work at the Embassy, but in many cases they did not know each other well until they began to play sports together.  Team USA is helping to build a stronger and more cohesive Mission while also promoting exercise and healthy habits.

Team USA is also building relationships with other teams in Phnom Penh.  On weekends, Team USA plays against other teams from local schools, businesses, NGOs, and the government.  On Saturday, I had the honor to cheer for our team in a match against the New York International School.  The competition was fierce but friendly, and in the end the New York International School squeaked out a victory.

Team USA may not have won on Saturday, but the players had a great time, as did I.  I am proud that Team USA is out representing the Embassy and I look forward to many more matches to come.

The University of Arizona is coming to #Cambodia!

At a ceremony today at the American University of Phnom Penh (AUPP), the University of Arizona announced that it will be opening a micro campus in Phnom Penh, becoming the first U.S. university to establish a physical presence in Cambodia.

The University of Arizona and AUPP signed a dual degree program agreement, under which students will be able to study full time in Cambodia and receive degrees from both schools. To begin, the program will offer undergraduate degrees in business and law. The University of Arizona plans to include degrees in engineering and architecture in the near future.

Ambassador Heidt served as a witness to the signing of this historic agreement, saying that, As the U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia, I take great pride when U.S. institutions make strategic investments here, especially when those investments stand to develop the human and intellectual resources of Cambodias dynamic youth sector, represented by the young people who are with us today.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

As a reader of my blog, you probably know about how much I love watching movies.  As I said in a previous entry about the power of film, movies not only bring people together; they also become an important part of our historical memory.  Several people around the world are also fans of the big screen, so it is no surprise that the Academy Awards  also known as the Oscars  is one of the most watched events of the year.  In fact, the Oscars rank as the second biggest draw in U.S. television after the Super Bowl.  Beginning in 1929, the golden statues that are given to winners are recognized around the world and considered by many to be the most prestigious award anyone in the film industry can win. 

Here in Cambodia, the film industry is growing and beginning to receive well-deserved recognition both at home and internationally.  Last year, Rithy Panhs The Missing Picture was the first Cambodian film to be nominated for an Oscar.  This achievement helped bring much more attention to Cambodias history and culture as well as the creativity and talent that can be found among the countrys actors, directors, writers, and others involved with making films.  In October 2014, film director Sotho Kulikar received the Spirit of Asia Award at the prestigious Tokyo International Film Festival for The Last Reel.  American director John Pirozzis Dont Think Ive Forgotten:  Cambodias Lost Rock and Roll was featured during last years Cambodia International Film Festival and will premiere in the United States at the renowned Film Forum in New York City in April 2015.

The Academy Awards show commands an estimated global audience of more than 1 billion annually.  For this years event, I joined some of Cambodias biggest stars and filmmakers for an Oscar viewing party at the Le Grand Palais Boutique Hotel in Phnom Penh.  Hosted by the Cambodia Oscar Selection Committee, the event was full of the glamour that you can find in Hollywood on Oscar night, but it was in the morning due to the time difference between Cambodia and the United States.   

This years Academy Awards ran almost four hours long, so unfortunately I was could not watch it in its entirety.  For any of my readers that were able to watch the Oscars, I would love to hear your thoughts about the show.  Was one of the movies or performers that you loved from 2014 nominated or selected as a winner?  Did you see any of your favorite Hollywood stars?  Do you think that a certain person or film was left out of this years list of nominees?

Filled with fashion, food, and fun, it was the sixth year of the Hollywood Awards Live viewing party.  I would like to thank the members of the Cambodia Oscar Selection Committee for the invitation to the event.  It was a wonderful occasion and I was honored to be among so many Cambodian celebrities.

While there were no Cambodian Oscar nominees this year, I am confident that there will more to come in the near future.  With or without the Academy Award, Cambodians continue to accomplish remarkable feats in filmmaking.  These efforts give a voice to the people of Cambodia while bringing the countrys rich history and culture to the entire world.  I commend the people that I met at the viewing party and others helping to restore the film industry in Cambodia  an achievement that will endure even longer than the glitz of a golden Oscar trophy.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

A recent news article reported that many Cambodians prefer to learn English as a second language.  I am pleased to hear that Cambodians  especially youth  are excited about English language learning.  As I have mentioned before in previous blogs, English is the most commonly used language in international business, science, and higher education.  The ability to communicate in English is an important skill in todays globalized economy, especially with the economic integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) later this year.  I believe that learning English will enable Cambodians to pursue future educational and economic opportunities and allow them to contribute to the development of Cambodia.  That is why Im pleased the U.S. Embassy can support the aspirations of Cambodians to improve their English language skills through the wide range of programs that we offer. 

To help Cambodians develop their English skills, the U.S. Embassy sponsors talented 13-20 year-old students from economically disadvantaged communities throughout the country through the English Access Microscholarship Program.  Since 2004, the English Access program has provided students with a foundation of English language skills with after-school classes and intensive summer learning activities.  This weekend, over 120 English Access students from Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Speu, Kampong Thom, Stung Treng, and Takeo provinces will travel to Phnom Penh to take part in our annual English Camp  an all-day event for students to improve and practice their English through fun activities and presentations.  I hope every student will have a great learning experience while also getting to know their peers.  And to the organizers, trainers, and volunteers behind this years English Camp, thank you for your tremendous efforts!

I also want to congratulate the more than 1,000 Cambodian students that have successfully completed the two-year English Access program.  I am delighted to learn that English Access alumni have gone on to pursue advanced university degrees, work as reporters at local radio stations, serve as interpreters and translators, and climb the ranks in the private sector.  Furthermore, Access alumni have continued their involvement with the U.S. Embassy.  For example, Yourk Senghong is currently a member of my Youth Council, and many alumni have participated in U.S. government exchange programs.

The U.S. Embassy also offers programs to help working professionals improve their English language skills.  For example, the Lower Mekong Initiatives (LMI) Professional Communication Skills for Leaders seminar helps Cambodian government officials further develop their leadership and English language skills in preparation for key international conferences like the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference.  Additionally, the seminar enables participants to effectively communicate with their counterparts across the region on cross-border issues such as economic integration and environmental protection.  Now in its third year, over 250 Cambodian government officials from over 10 government ministries have successfully completed the one-week intensive English language course.  Just last week, a ceremony was held to congratulate Cambodian government officials who have successfully completed the program.  I want to recognize the Cambodian government for its collaboration with the U.S. Embassy to make this a successful program.

Recently, the U.S. Embassy funded an English language training course for 14 Cambodian journalists from 12 major news organizations.  The purpose of the pilot program is to help the journalists improve their English skills and to promote long-term cooperation between the U.S. Embassy and working journalists in Cambodia.  We expect to see good outcomes from the pilot program, and hopefully build on its success in years to come.

These and other programs help to increase Cambodias competitiveness by giving people the ability to pursue higher quality education and better jobs.  It opens doors to a vast amount of information on the internet to help further their ability to achieve goals in an unlimited array of ventures.  Furthermore, Cambodians will have the opportunity to utilize the knowledge and skills that they have acquired to assist in developing their communities.  Through these programs, the United States remains committed to helping the people of Cambodia to achieve success and prosperity.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

This week, a dynamic group of 72 young leaders between the ages of 18 to 25  all members of President Obamas Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI)  came to Siem Reap to participate in the ""YSEALI Generation: EARTH"" workshop. The purpose of this four-day regional exchange is to foster a deeper understanding of climate change, deforestation, and other challenges to the environment facing the ASEAN region and beyond. By fostering leadership development, building peer networks, and providing mentors, the event helps to empower young Cambodians and their neighbors to effectively collaborate to address environmental issues.

The workshop  funded by a grant through the U.S. Embassy  is implemented by Cultural Vistas, a U.S.-based NGO that provides international internships, study tours, language immersion, and cultural exchange programs for more than 5,000 people annually. By partnering with Pannasastra University of Cambodia (PUC) in Siem Reap, the event organizers received valuable local knowledge that was needed to plan the workshop. Another critical aspect of YSEALI Generation: EARTH is the group of 24 Leader Mentors between the ages of 26 to 35, with 12 from the United States and 12 from various ASEAN nations. These leader mentors use their combined expertise as environmental advocates and social entrepreneurs to guide the participants through virtual exercises prior to the workshop, interactive sessions during the workshop, and the implementation of environmental action plans in communities throughout Southeast Asia after the workshop concludes.

I was thrilled to join the YSEALI participants on the opening day of the workshop and give the official welcome. Joining me were officials from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Environment, as well as representatives from the provincial government and the APSARA Authority. I found the energy in the room from bringing all these people together very exciting, and I felt it was important to let everyone know just how much the United States values cross- cultural exchange as an effective means for solving some of the worlds greatest challenges. I really wanted to be at this event to show the participants  which included 18 Cambodian YSEALI members  that they are not alone in their endeavors. It is my strong belief that each of these young leaders possess the ability to help teach thousands of people throughout the region about the importance of protecting our precious wildlife, forests, and natural resources. The YSEALI Generation: EARTH event is just one example of our commitment to the youth in the region.

The workshop includes a series of lectures on regional and global environmental issues, interactive discussions, and site visits to illustrate the lessons discussed. A major reason why Cambodia was selected as host for this event is because it is a country that is trying to find a balance between the preservation of irreplaceable resources and the increase of development activities which stimulates the economy and lifts the population out of poverty. Also, with the biodiversity and ecosystems found in Cambodia under threat from climate change, the YSEALI participants are able to see firsthand what is being done to address this problem, meeting with community members to learn about solutions that have been developed locally.

Later in the week, my Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung joined the YSEALI participants as they visited the Floating Village of Kampong Phluk on the Tonle Sap, the largest body of freshwater in Southeast Asia. After helping to plant 200 trees earlier in the week, the YSEALI members placed markers around protected fisheries in an area near the village, helping community members to protect their environment and preserve their livelihood in preparation for the rainy season. Julie would later help to inspire the youth leaders by talking about being strong agents for change and encouraging them to be active in their communities to bring awareness to issues important to them, such as the environment.  But she also told them that she would be returning to Phnom Penh inspired by their actions this week and their plans for the future to implement some of the ideas they learned in their home countries.

Caring for our earth is an issue that is important to all of us.  The U.S. Embassy is proud to support the YSEALI Generation: EARTH workshop and all of the young leaders that participated in this weeks activities.  Through ongoing collaboration with Cambodia, ASEAN member nations, and the world, we can develop sustainable solutions to address environmental challenges and strengthen capacity to manage natural resources.  I am pleased to know that these young leaders will be there  both now and in the future  helping others join efforts to protect our shared environment.

It's a trip that I felt I had to make, Sotie said.  Standing at the site of my childhood home, I was overwhelmed by memories of when our family was still together.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I am currently in the United States celebrating Christmas with my family.  Like many Americans and others around the world, we spent time together this week gathering with relatives and friends, decorating the Christmas tree, and sharing a holiday dinner complete with two of my favorite foods: turkey and pumpkin pie.  My children are older now, but I am delighted to see that they are still just as excited about this time of the year as their father.

Before coming to see my family in the U.S., I made sure to spend holiday time with my extended family in Cambodia as well.  I joined U.S. Embassy personnel and their family members to celebrate with good food and music on the Embassys lawn.  The children in attendance were even lucky enough to receive a visit from Santa Claus himself!  The event culminated with the holiday light show.  With thousands of lights accompanied by holiday music, it is a wonderful display of art and imagination.  If you have walked or driven by the Embassy at night this month, you have seen many Cambodian families sitting in the nearby park to watch the light show.  In the spirit of the holiday season, we are happy to share this festive American tradition with all of our friends in Cambodia.

During this time of the year, Americans observe a wide variety of holidays, including the Christian observance of Christmas, the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, and the African-American celebration of Kwanzaa.  Regardless of ones religious or ethnic background, Americans of all faiths and traditions spend this time to reflect on our shared values: unity among family and friends, appreciation for life, and a spirit of goodwill toward others.  While somewhat different, our holiday traditions are similar to those familiar to people in Cambodia.  Just as Americans celebrate this holiday season by sharing meals and exchanging gifts with our loved ones, Cambodians will be doing the same during the Khmer New Year.

The holiday season reminds us about the importance of reaching out and taking care of our fellow human beings.  Our Marine Security Guard Detachment at the U.S. Embassy has spent the last few months conducting a Toys for Tots campaign to provide Cambodian children with gifts and bring smiles to their faces.  Their goal is not to just give free toys, but to deliver a message of hope that will encourage these children and build their self-esteem.  Many of our extraordinary men and women in uniform serving around the world are not able to be with their families during the holidays.  This makes efforts like Toys for Tots all the more reason to acknowledge our Marines and their dedication to helping others.

I would like to express my appreciation to those who unselfishly serve others, not only during this holiday season, but on a daily basis.  Thanks to our U.S. military service members, American and Cambodian staff at the Embassy, our local and international NGO partners, and the many Cambodian men, women, and young people dedicated to moving Cambodia forward.  I wish you all a joyous and wonderful holiday season.

The Study of the United States Institutes (SUSI) sends scholars and secondary school teachers to well-known Universities in the United States for an amazing study in American culture, history and more.  

SUSI is a six-week intensive post-graduate level academic program that provides foreign university faculty, secondary school teachers and other scholars the opportunity to deepen their understanding of U.S. society, culture, values, and institutions.  Each year starting in June, the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia accepts SUSI applicants for two categories: SUSI for Scholars and SUSI for Secondary School Educators, which also includes secondary school administrators.

Dr. Kin Phea Professor of the International Relations Institute of Cambodia, participated in the 2014 SUSI for Scholars program and traveled to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  Dr. Phea says, ""The SUSI program is interesting and very useful for Cambodian scholars as well as other scholars from around the globe.  This program enabled me to gain a deeper understanding of American history, politics, tradition and culture.  The program is very good not only for promoting better international understanding of the U.S. history, politics and culture but also for deepening mutual understanding among participating scholars."" 

The Embassy is now accepting applications for SUSI candidates for both programs.  The deadline for submission is December 17th, 2014.  Submit your application here http://goo.gl/YOavim

For further information, prospective applicants are encouraged to visit the website http://exchanges.state.gov/susi, or contact the Alumni Coordinator, Akhara Uy, at 023 728 683.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Do you know that Prey Lang is the largest lowland evergreen forest in Cambodia and a significant watershed for the Tonle Sap Lake? A recent study funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (#USAID) revealed that the Prey Lang Forest is considered one of the worlds top 10 biodiversity hotspots  areas having large numbers of species found nowhere else. After a one-year biodiversity assessment was conducted by a team of Cambodian officials from the Forestry Administration and specialists from Winrock International and Conservation International, almost 1,000 species of plants and animals were discovered living in Prey Lang. This includes an astonishing 266 species of birds, which represents 44 percent of all bird species found in Cambodia. Furthermore, more than 250,000 people live in villages within or adjacent to Prey Lang, which spans Kampong Thom, Kratie, Preah Vihear, and Stung Treng Provinces.

However, Prey Lang is also an unprotected landscape and is being threatened by habitat loss and other human activities. Many people in Cambodia have voiced their opinions about conserving Prey Lang, as well as other major forests in the country, because these landscapes provide a source of livelihood for local communities and is also a home for a diverse range of wildlife species. I also believe that Cambodia can set a strong example in the global effort to fight climate change by preserving its forests, because trees have the ability to absorb and store carbon that would otherwise cause the earths temperature to rise. Since climate change has no boundaries, it affects all of us.

Scientists believe that rising temperatures will result in the changing pattern of wet and dry seasons in Cambodia. The dry season may now be longer, while the wet season is shorter and more intense, with less predictable rain showers. This can have a dramatic impact on agricultural productivity, one of the pillars of Cambodias economy, and will likely affect millions of Cambodian farmers. In order to address the critical challenge posed by climate change, it is critical that everyone contributes. Thats why the U.S. government works in partnership with the Cambodian government, civil society, and the private sector on a number of programs to address climate change. For example, Cambodias farmers are able to increase their income, improve food security, and adapt to the consequences of climate change through HARVEST, an integrated food security and climate change program. USAID is also helping to reduce deforestation rates and conserve biodiversity across more than one million hectares of forests and plains through the Supporting Forests and Biodiversity project.

In order to educate the next generation of leaders in climate change, Cambodias first university-level climate change curriculum was launched earlier this year. Professor Bunleng Se, who works in the Department of Geography and Land Management at the Royal University of Phnom Penh, is a champion of this new curriculum. Through our Lowering Emissions in Asias Forests (LEAF) program, we were happy to support Professor Se along with other professors, forest specialists, and climate change experts from universities across Southeast Asia to collaboratively develop the climate change curriculum. Together, they created new learning modules and teaching materials to advance climate change education in Cambodia and other countries in the region.

nother potential consequence of climate change is access to safe drinking water during a prolonged dry season. To help rural communities in Cambodia protect their water supply, the Ministry of Rural Development, with support from the USAID Adapt Asia-Pacific project, evaluated ponds in the Tonle Sap region and developed designs to cope with climate change. Using the new designs will help ensure better quality water for the millions of Cambodians who depend on community water supply ponds for their drinking water during the dry season.

Because climate change is a global challenge, no government can address the issue alone. Thats why I believe we can overcome these challenges by working together and setting good examples for future generations.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Cambodia has enormous potential. With 70 percent of its youth under the age of 30, investing in youth is investing in the future of Cambodia  and with great returns. As some of you know, shortly after I arrived in Cambodia in 2012, I formed the Ambassadors Youth Council (AYC) as a way to cultivate young Cambodian leaders from around the country. From our first meeting, these young individuals have inspired me. Their enthusiasm to improve their communities, and the world, is reflected in their projects. Over the years they have met with me monthly to discuss these projects which have focused on education, entrepreneurship, wildlife protection, and womens empowerment initiatives  all issues vital to our future. 

Some of the highlights from the past two years include helping to develop an internship program where the AYC partnered with the Cambodia chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) to design a program which placed Cambodian university students in internships at AmCham-member businesses. The AYC also visited the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue to learn first-hand about environmental challenges and how to engage youth on environmental protection issues. And they co-organized an incredible Wild for Life concert with the NGO Wildlife Alliance at the Phnom Pehn Night Market which featured musical and comedy performances on the theme of wildlife conservation. Finally, the AYC organized two screenings of the Nicholas Kristoff documentary Half the Sky:

Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide. The screenings included a special message from Mr. Kristoff for the Cambodian audience, and a panel discussion on womens empowerment and combatting trafficking. Each of these accomplishments is impressive on its own, but the whole of what has been accomplished by the AYC is truly inspirational. 

This week, some AYC members graduated from the program, and I am proud to say they are all moving on to great endeavors. Over the past years, I watched these youth grow into confident young men and women. Some shed their introverted personalities and stepped into the limelight. Others learned critical thinking skills. And all members developed leadership skills that will take them far in their chosen careers. 

Some of these council members are continuing their studies in graduate schoola handful of which are studying abroad in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Some have taken their AYC experiences to further their work. For example, Chea Vannak was a freelance journalist when he joined the AYC, but now is a professional journalist at the Khmer Times. He credits his time with the AYC for giving him a boost in his skills and confidence as a leader. 

When Soeum Soren joined the AYC, she was already working with Legal Support for Children and Women (LSCW), a local NGO that promotes rights and justice for women, girls and children who suffer from gender-based violence. Soren now tells me that she passed a difficult exam and works at the Ministry of Justice. She credits her two years with AYC for helping her realize her dreams.

Seldom in my line of diplomatic work  where I live and serve in any given country for only two to four years at a time  do I get to see projects that I start come to fruition. As a group, these graduating youth were wonderful to work with. As individuals, each one is a smart, motivated, curious, self-starter. I am truly a fortunate person for having spent time with them.

Serving as a mentor is a responsibility that I take very seriously in my role as U.S. Ambassador. At its most basic level, mentoring is investing in the future. Mentors can keep encouraging youth to stay in school, to apply for university, to challenge themselves and improve their potential. In this way, we can prepare todays youth for the challenges they will face tomorrow. 

For more information on my youth council, please visit http://cambodia.usembassy.gov/ayc.html.

If you find the type of projects I have talked about here exciting but are not a member of my youth council, please consider joining the Young Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative (YSEALI), President Obamas signature program to strengthen leadership development and networking in Southeast Asia.  I encourage you to join AYC members and the 2,000+ Cambodian youth who already participate in YSEALI to discuss entrepreneurship and civic engagement, and take significant action to address issues that matter most in your communities.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

The education of children is a matter that is near and dear to my heart.  I believe every child in Cambodia should have access to an education that will not only help him or her to fulfill their potential, but also to help their country develop economically to attain long-term prosperity.  My staff at the Embassy shares this commitment to education.  Last week, Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung visited a demonstration school in Kampong Cham province run by local NGO Kampuchean Action for Primary Education (KAPE) to learn about this new, transparent model for funding education.

During her visit, Julie toured the demonstration school facilities, which includes a science lab, classrooms, library, career counseling center, computer lab, and model farm.  She learned about KAPE and its mission to work with government, the community, and other stakeholders to improve education in Cambodia.  KAPE implements projects in over 300 schools in 11 provinces across Cambodia that benefit more than 150,000 children.  USAID in Cambodia recently concluded a five-year project with KAPE that included curriculum development, remedial assistance for children with learning needs, and the construction of several classrooms and facilities.

I applaud KAPEs innovative work at the demonstration school, which demonstrates the feasibility of reforms that could benefit Cambodias education system.  For example, the school has developed a voluntary cost sharing fee structure to fund its operations.  The use of this transparent fee is aimed to eliminate under the table payments to teachers.  In addition, the school has worked to improve management and governance to ensure accountability and performance.  These improvements help to create trust between students and parents and the school, which is a fundamental part of delivering a good education.

I was also delighted that Julie had the opportunity to meet with Mary Hem, one of the staff members at KAPE.  In 2013, Mary participated in the U.S. government sponsored YSEALI Professional Fellows Program in the state of Montana.  This prestigious month-long fellowship in the United States allowed Mary to broaden her expertise on womens empowerment and to network with American colleagues and emerging leaders from around the world.  It is inspiring to see how Mary is using her experience in the United States to advocate for gender equality in education and to mentor students in Kampong Cham.

I strongly believe that a comprehensive education system has the power to enable the young people of Cambodia to improve their lives and their country.  An educated workforce spurs innovation and investment in business and industry, driving economic growth and expansion of the middle class.  In turn, a growing middle class leads to further economic, social, and political development.  The United States will continue to support organizations like KAPE and people like Mary Hem as they work to ensure that Cambodias youth have the opportunity to succeed in life.

In Cambodia, the U.S. government has been promoting literacy by supporting the Total Reading Approach for Children (TRAC) project.  This project helps Grade 1 and 2 students learn to read through the use of a number of new tools.  

One of these tools, a system of benchmark testing, has proven so effective that it is being adopted by the Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport, to enhance Cambodias early grade reading curriculum.  Other innovative aspects of this program include the use of peer tutoring and a new Khmer language m-learning application.  M-learning, or mobile learning, allows students to access their materials via personal electronic devices.  This gives the students the freedom to practice their reading away from school, with parents or friends.  

TRAC is an innovative pilot project implemented by World Education, Inc. in partnership with local NGO Kampuchean Action for Primary Education (KAPE) in eight rural, semi-urban, and urban primary schools in Kampong Cham and Siem Riep provinces.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in partnership with World Vision and the Australian government fund this program through the challenge grant All Children Reading.

Resolutions for the New Year 
-From the Ambassador's Penh

As I prepare to celebrate the start of a new year in the United States, I see that many Americans are reflecting on the past and anticipating the future with many customs brought by our diverse immigrant population from Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America.    The festivities actually begin on the night of December 31 with parties, concerts, television specials, and other events followed by spectacular fireworks displays.  On the first day of the New Year, people in many U.S. cities and towns watch American football games, parades, and shows about the main events from the previous year.  No matter how one chooses to celebrate, Americans recognize this time as an opportunity to reflect on prior achievements and plan for the upcoming year.

For many people, another important tradition that makes this day special is creating a New Years resolution.  This is a personal commitment to accomplish something important to them during the New Year.  Studies show that about 45 percent of Americans make New Years resolutions annually, with a significant number of people finding the determination to achieve their goals.  Making a resolution offers a fresh start, whether you are doing something for the first time or renewing an effort that was not successful in the past.  The New Years resolution is grounded in the fundamental belief that we can improve our lives as long as we continue to try our best.

President Abraham Lincoln said, Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.  When thinking about a New Years resolution, it is helpful to choose an objective that can be successfully reached.  These goals may be short-term or long-term, simple or complex, individual or shared.  Some of the most common New Years resolutions for Americans include:
 Focusing on health:  Lose weight, exercise, eat healthier foods.
 Becoming more financially savvy:  Lower debts, save money.
 Quitting a bad habit:  Drink less alcohol, quit smoking.
 Improving professionally:  Find a better job, pursue higher education.
 Traveling more:  Plan a trip.
 Being more environmentally responsible:  Reduce, reuse, recycle.
 Serving others:  Volunteer more.
As you can see, these are positive goals that can be achieved with a committed effort.  While optimism and the can-do attitude are values deeply cherished in the United States, Cambodians also believe that a better future is possible through dedication and hard work.  This is why I am sure that my readers can relate to the idea of a New Years resolution.

Committing to a personal resolution is a New Years tradition that I have always loved.  While spending time here with my family in the United States, I have also been coming up with some New Years resolutions that I look forward to starting upon my return to Cambodia.  I plan on taking more trips throughout the country, particularly to areas that I have not yet visited.  While traveling this year to places like Krati Province and the Prek Toal Bird Sanctuary and Floating Village along the Tonl Sap, I learned a great deal from my interactions with Cambodians living in the rural parts of the country.  I will continue to speak with and listen to the public  both directly and via social media  about the issues that matter most to the Cambodian people.  With over 350,000 Facebook fans and more than 35,000 followers on Twitter to date, I look forward to increasing our reach so that even more people can be involved in meaningful dialogue with us about Cambodias future.  Focusing on the future of the entire country, I will promote youth outreach and work to improve the daily lives of the average Cambodian.  By encouraging Cambodian youth to join the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), I am confident that they will be able to strengthen their leadership and networking skills.  Last but not least, I will remain committed to a prosperous and mutually beneficial friendship between the United States and Cambodia.

Even though the Khmer New Year in April is a much larger celebration than January 1 in Cambodia, the New Years resolution is something that I would like to share with you.  I am grateful to the many Cambodians who have helped me learn about your customs and holidays, so hopefully you will join me in taking part in this American tradition.  As we get ready to for the first day of 2015, I wish all of you peace, health, and happiness in 2015. 

What are your New Years resolutions?  Please feel free to let me know in the comments section.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

It has been said that the mark of a good community is one that takes care of its most vulnerable members.  The Statue of Liberty  the iconic sculpture that greets visitors to New York City  quotes a famous poem that welcomes the poor and oppressed to Americas shores.  The words evoke a commitment to provide all who come to America the opportunity to pursue their dreams and become productive members of their communities.

I was recently reminded of this sentiment when the Special Olympics, the U.S. government, and the Royal Government of Cambodia launched a new initiative  the Rural Expansion of Sports.  This project involves outreach in four Cambodian provinces  Takeo, Battambang, Svey Rieng, and Kampong Thom  to recruit more than 1,000 people with intellectual disabilities for Special Olympics Cambodia.  Over the course of the project, specialized training will be provided for these athletes so that they can represent Cambodia at the Special Olympics.

I really look forward to seeing the newly recruited athletes as they get involved in sports; improve their health; discover new strengths, abilities, and skills; experience joy and success; and possibly represent their country in the international Special Olympics competition.  I expect that their involvement in the program will help them become more active participants in the lives of their families and communities.  This is an important aspect of the Special Olympics ethos  helping the athletes, families, and communities come closer together.

One way in which the Special Olympics helps build bonds within these families is by encouraging family member involvement in the Family Support Network.  This network is a support group for sharing information about care-giving and relationship-building.  Training is also provided so that family members can become volunteers and coaches to support Special Olympics competitions and the athletes in attaining their highest levels of achievement.

The support and commitment shown by the Royal Government for this new initiative has been exemplary.  During his speech at the launch this week, H.E. Dr. Meas Sarin, Advisor to the Ministry of Education Youth and Sport and the Permanent Vice President of the Special Olympics, emphasized Cambodias commitment to ensuring the well-being and livelihood of every Cambodian, including persons with disabilities.

Im proud of the work and contributions of the U.S. government partnering with Cambodians in support of the disabled community.  Through the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization we support state-of-the-art counseling services for Cambodians suffering from mental health illnesses, including hundreds of people who experienced trauma under the Khmer Rouge.  We are also sponsoring public outreach campaigns to help educate persons with disabilities about their rights and responsibilities as citizens.  Through Veterans International Cambodia we are able to assist in the provision of prosthetic devices to thousands of victims of landmines, motorcycle and automobile accidents, and birth defects.  You can learn more about these efforts at www.usaid.gov/cambodia.

Supporting persons with disabilities is very much part of the United States commitment to help the worlds most vulnerable people play a greater role in their communities.  I hope when Cambodia fields its team of athletes at the next Special Olympics you will join me in a loud, long cheer for Cambodia.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

The world continues to mourn the passing of B.B. King, the iconic American singer, songwriter, and guitarist that helped bring the blues music to audiences around the world.  Recognized as the King of the Blues and one of the greatest guitar players of all time, King is in the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and won 15 Grammys, including the Lifetime Achievement and Grammy Hall of Fame awards.  But perhaps Kings most significant and lasting contribution is the influence that his music has had in the lives of millions of people to this day. 

In President Obamas recent statement on the loss of B.B. King, he said that the musician became the ambassador who brought his all-American music to his country and the world.  After playing his first overseas concert in France in 1968, King would go on to travel the world and play for audiences in various countries throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia.  In 1971, he became the first blues singer to ever play in Japan and later served as a cultural exchange ambassador for the U.S. Department of State for tours in West Africa and the former Soviet Union.

Blues music originated in African-American communities in the United States in the late 19th century but has since spread all around the world.  Many countries have adopted the blues or have made their own versions.  A couple of years ago I first learned about Kong Nay, one of the few great musicians who survived the Khmer Rouge era.  Kong Nay is also like B.B. King in that he has a powerful voice and a captivating instrument called the chapei dang weng.  The album Mekong Delta Blues with his talented protg Ouch Savy is wonderful, and although Master Kong Nay has retired, he continues to serve as a role model for young musicians.  

There are a number of other musicians with Cambodian roots that are helping to keep blues music alive.  Bonny B., a successful Cambodian-French harmonica musician, also set the Guinness Book of World Records mark in 2009 for the longest harmonica marathon, playing his instrument for 24 hours without a single break.  Krom, a Cambodia-based band that features two Khmer singers and sisters Sophea and Sopheak, fuse a classic blues style with traditional Khmer music.  I wrote in a previous blog about my passion for live music, so I would love to see these and other acts perform in the near future.

B.B. King will forever be remembered for using his talent to bring people from diverse backgrounds together.  His legacy teaches us that the bonds of mutual understanding can be strengthened with the universal language of music.  My favorite and probably Kings most famous song is The Thrill is Gone, which you can watch him perform in the YouTube video below.  One thing is for certain: the thrill of B.B. King will always be with us, living on through those who continue to emulate his style and the fans who continue to listen to his music.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

If you are a regular reader of my blog, you already know that I am a big fan of the work that members of the U.S. Navys Mobile Construction Battalion  called Seabees, from the initials CB  are doing in towns and villages all over Cambodia. What makes this work so valuable is that it focuses on health and education  two areas that have the most direct impact on the lives of regular, hard-working Cambodians. The Seabees can often be found building wells, health centers, and school buildings, but no matter what they do the goal is always to improve the quality of life of Cambodians.

Seabees work hard to respond to the specific needs of local communities . For example, when the Seabees learned that the Angkor Hospital for Children in Siem Reap needed renovation and improvement, they were more than happy to give their support. The Seabees removed and repainted a number of interior walls at the hospital to create more usable space, which provided a much needed facelift to this important medical facility that serves more than 150,000 pediatric patients a year.

The Seabees also work closely with another group of Americans who are dedicated to serving others  our Peace Corps Volunteers. Earlier this year, the Seabees pitched in to provide supplies and transport equipment for the Create Cambodia Arts Festival in Kandal Province organized by Peace Corps Volunteers. The festival brought together 170 Cambodian students for workshops on visual arts, music, theater, dance, and other art disciplines, and provided a venue for students to showcase the art pieces that they had worked very hard to perfect. The logistical support provided by the Seabees ensured that the festival was a big success.

The Seabees know that in order for children to reach their potential they need safe and comfortable places to learn. Not long ago, the Seabees helped renovate the library at Koh Andet High School in Takeo Province. Working alongside community members and students, the Seabees helped repaint the interior wall space and repair numerous bookshelves that had fallen into disrepair. This renovation project will aid the schools efforts to improve literacy and to instill the students with a love of reading.

The Seabees are known for their skills in construction, but they also perform other kinds of community service. In another educational project, the Seabees distributed English language vocabulary books to Samdech Chea Sim Primary School in Sihanoukville. The Seabees provided 300 textbooks to the school library to be used by 1,200 primary school students. The books were donated to the local community by U.S. schools through a program called Project Hand Class. The books significantly expanded the librarys collection and will support English language teaching in the community.

These are just a few of the many projects that the Seabees are doing to promote health, education, culture, and development in Cambodia. By using their skills in construction and community service, the Seabees are enriching and improving the lives of thousands of Cambodians and helping to create places where Cambodians can learn, get well, and serve their communities.

In addition to academic programs leading to college degrees (e.g. associates degrees), community colleges offer vocational education and technical training. Community colleges also usually have strong ties with their state's universities. This makes it easier for the student to transfer to one of these universities to complete the last two years of a four year Bachelors Degree after completing an Associates Degree at the Community College. The cost of a Community College is significantly less than a four year university and although they are less expensive you can still receive an excellent education there. Many American and international students attend the first two years of study in a community college with lower costs and easier admission policies to take many of the required subjects connected to their degree and then transfer for their last two years to a four year university.

- From the Ambassador's Penh

It is a well-known fact that agriculture has made a profound impact on the economic growth of Cambodia.  In a previous blog, I highlighted how sustainable, climate resilient agriculture also plays a role in poverty reduction by employing over 50 percent of the Kingdoms population.  As a single part of the economy, agriculture accounts for more than 30 percent of Cambodias Gross Domestic Product.  And thanks to a pro-business regulatory framework and an average growth rate of seven percent per year over the last decade, Cambodia is poised to see the continued expansion of agribusiness and related sectors.  This will provide many great opportunities for trade and business with the country.

Cambodian rice is an excellent example of the value added to the economy by the success of the countrys farmers and agricultural businesses.  Cambodian jasmine was once again honored as the best rice in the world.  This is a noteworthy achievement that highlights the quality of the Kingdoms agricultural products and the potential for increased rice exports.  It is also excellent news for ongoing efforts to eradicate extreme poverty in Cambodia.  

However, rice is not Cambodias only success story.  Mango growers in Cambodia get two crops a year from their trees, once in March or April and again in October or November.  This double harvest, unseen in many other places, gives Cambodia an edge in providing delicious, quality fruit - for both domestic demand and a growing export market.  However, as the mango industry and other areas of Cambodias agricultural sector continue to expand, there are certain issues that could present challenges in the future.  For example, capacity-building to promote increased productivity and the use of modern farming technology and equipment would provide even greater benefits to Cambodias agricultural sector.

Thankfully, Cambodia has partners to help develop solutions to these challenges and help send a strong message to the world that the country is ready to share in the continued success of agribusiness.  Recently, John Deere Chairman and CEO Sam Allen and other company executives visited Cambodia, showing that American companies also recognize the Kingdoms potential for future growth in agribusiness.  As a giant in the manufacturing, sale and export of high-quality agricultural heavy equipment and machinery, John Deeres visit to Cambodia  which included a tour of the RMA Cambodias Phnom Penh facility and a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Sok An  is a positive sign that Cambodias agriculture sector is expected to remain profitable for years to come.  The visit is also a symbol of the strong trade relationship between the United States and Cambodia in support of mutual economic benefit.

The United States remains committed to supporting Cambodias economic growth, which includes the success of its agribusiness sector.  Several U.S. government initiatives and partnerships funded through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) recognize the challenges in helping thousands of farmers increase their income and meet the growing demand for their products.  Through the US Presidential Initiative called Feed the Future, USAID programs are responding by introducing new varieties of rice and helping Cambodian farmers to diversify their incomes with different crops and knowledge of seasonal rotation methods.  Through improved agricultural practices and new technologies, USAIDs HARVEST program alone has increased productivity and income for 44,450 smallholder rice farmers, further contributing to the success of Cambodias award-winning rice sector.  

I strongly believe that the combined efforts of the United States, the Cambodian government, civil society, the private sector, and most importantly the farmers of Cambodia will continue to shape the agricultural sector and lead to a sustainable business model that will benefit Cambodians for years to come.  What do you think could be done to further promote agriculture and economic growth in Cambodia?

-From the Ambassador's Penh

According to estimates, more than 20 million people around the world are living as modern-day slaves  many lured away from their homes by promises of higher paying jobs.  On Tuesday, we received some good news when 59 Cambodian fishermen arrived at Phnom Penh International Airport, bringing to an end their nightmare of emotional and physical abuse on fishing boats in the seas around Indonesia.  Some of the men had been away for as long as five years, financially and physically shackled to an industry that is often known for taking advantage of people who are unable to defend themselves.

The U.S. government is proud to have played a role in the return of these 59 fishermen through USAIDs Counter Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) program, which financed their voyage back to Cambodia.  Id like to thank USAIDs partners, Winrock International and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), for taking on this important project to bring them home.

I can only imagine how deeply emotional the mens return will be to their families and friends.  Many of the families havent heard from their sons, husbands, or fathers for several years.  All of them will begin a new journey now as they look to reintegrate into Cambodian society.  In addition to physical wounds, many of the returnees have suffered mental and emotional trauma.  They will need help to reconnect to the communities that they left behind.  They will also need new skills and a helping hand to start a business or find a job that will support them and their families.  The U.S. Embassy and our partners will continue to provide support through the CTIP program as they go through this process.

The mens return to Phnom Penh this week is a welcome point of light on an otherwise dark horizon.  Even though slavery is outlawed all over the world, too many men, women  and even children  are modern-day slaves condemned to lives of great suffering and injustice.  In Cambodia, sexual and labor trafficking continues to threaten the countrys youth.  Its important that we work together to protect young people from this scourge.

Im pleased to say we are working with many partners to put an end to trafficking.  USAIDs CTIP program works in lockstep with Cambodias National Committee for CTIP to implement their recently approved National Plan of Action.  Just last month, our CTIP program, working through local partner Legal Support for Children and Women (LSCW), began providing legal assistance to four Cambodian women who were trafficked to China as brides.  With help from the Cambodian embassy in China and Winrock, one of the women has returned to her community in Kampong Cham province.

Every time a trafficking victim comes home is a cause for celebration, but there is still much more to do.  The U.S. Embassy is committed to working with our local and international partners to end trafficking in Cambodia and to bring home all Cambodians who are being trafficked overseas.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

As the U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia, I am often asked about my work as a diplomat.  In the world of diplomacy, government officials attend meetings and hold discussions to resolve differences and work towards a common goal.  While this is definitely an important aspect of U.S. engagement with Cambodia, there are many other ways where people of our two countries can connect.  For instance, the universal passion for sports is one way to transcend language barriers and cultural differences in order to bring people together.  International sporting events like the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, where athletes from Cambodia and other nations in the region compete for gold medals in 36 sports, is a prime example of sports diplomacy.  Since 1959, the SEA Games have been held to build strong regional cooperation, understanding, and unity within the Southeast Asian community.  This year, Singapore is hosting the 28th SEA Games, which kicks off this week.

Among the many athletes who will represent Cambodia at the SEA Games are several Cambodian-Americans.  The 12-man roster of the Cambodian mens basketball team includes seven Cambodian-Americans who have committed their time and energy to represent Cambodia.  Four of the players  Sopheark Mith, Sopheeng Toun, Dominic Dar, and William Em  are from Lowell, Massachusetts, a city that has the second-highest percentage of Cambodian population of any city in the United States.  Vannak Som and Jonathan Koy are from California, and Phanat Sary Ouch hails from Texas but currently lives in Cambodia.  I believe their combined experience and love of the game of basketball will not only help the team compete at the SEA Games, but also to help develop the sport in Cambodia.  I am also proud of these young men for building connections with the Cambodian people by sharing their American culture.  

The Cambodian mens basketball team begins group play against Thailand on June 9.  I want to wish them, and all Cambodian athletes, great success at the SEA Games.  Every athlete competing at the SEA Games is an ambassador representing their country.  I hope all the athletes will interact with one another to increase dialogue and cultural understanding.  Personally, I cant think of a better way to build personal connections than through a common passion for sport.

Will you be following the SEA Games?  How do you plan to support Team Cambodia?

 - From the Ambassador's Penh

In my latest column, I wrote about the importance of disability rights in Cambodia and the fact that this month marks the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States.  The anniversary of the ADA is a reminder that there is still more work to be done to ensure the rights of persons with disabilities in Cambodia and around the world.  In my series highlighting civil society organizations, I want to draw your attention to Veterans International Cambodia (VIC), whose vital work is improving the lives of persons with disabilities in Cambodia.

In Cambodia, there are an estimated 700,000 persons who are disabled as a result of landmines, motorcycle and automobile accidents, birth defects, and other causes.  Ive learned that in addition to discrimination, persons with disabilities often face physical, social, and economic barriers that prevent them from receiving quality and affordable health care, rehabilitation, education, and other services.  Many of these individuals need rehabilitation, artificial limbs and braces, and other necessary services to overcome challenges in their life, thus enabling them to realize their potential and more fully participate in society.

Thats why I believe the work of VIC is so critical.  Since opening the Kien Kheang Clinic in 1992, VIC has assisted in the rehabilitation of Cambodians living with disabilities to help them meet their basic daily needs.  The organization also opened centers in Prey Veng and Kratie provinces to extend its services to other parts of the country.  To date, VIC has provided rehabilitation services to tens of thousands of Cambodians and is one of the main providers of prosthetics and orthotics in the country.

I am pleased that the U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), recently launched the Rehabilitation and Prosthetics Program for Persons with Disabilities in Cambodia.  The program will allow VIC to continue to provide rehabilitation and prosthetic services for persons with disabilities.  Working in close coordination with the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY), VIC is assisting the Cambodian government as it takes on greater responsibility in providing these critical services to its citizens.  The USAID-funded program will help ensure a smooth transition as the Cambodian government assumes charge of VICs three rehabilitation centers by the end of 2016.

I would like to recognize the Royal Government of Cambodia for adopting and implementing a number of laws, regulations, and policies to address challenges facing persons with disabilities in the Kingdom.  The United States is committed to working with the Cambodian government, individuals, and organizations like VIC to support persons with disabilities.  By working together, I believe we can make progress in securing equal opportunities in education, employment, and everyday life for disabled persons in Cambodia.

Many particulars of the Ministrys eight-point reform strategy have been taking shape in recent months.  For example, salaries of teachers were increased and the payment system for teachers has been streamlined.  Although the increase in pay is small, it is an important first step.  And the new method of making direct payment to teachers bank accounts means that salaries can be paid on time, at regular intervals, and with greater safeguards against embezzlement.  These changes help support teachers so they can focus on the quality of their work and the progress to be made in the classroom.

In the spirit of the ADA, we would like to recognize the amazing members of  #Cambodia's Wheelchair Basketball Federation (CWBF).

Established with support from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), players on the Cambodian Women's Wheelchair Basketball team from Battambang and Kampong Speu provinces came to Phnom Penh for the July 15 NBA-WNBA Sports Envoy event at Olympic Stadium. For the thousands of people in the audience and viewing live via Facebook, watching the players' amazing talents and passion for the game was the highlight of the event.

Some members of the CWBF were also granted an audience with Her Majesty Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk, who offered to lend assistance to the construction of a new roof for the basketball court at the ICRC's physical rehabilitation center in Battambang.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Today is Earth Day, an annual event celebrated on April 22 in which citizens take action to demonstrate their support for protecting the environment.  The first Earth Day was held in 1970 when 20 million Americans rallied to demand clean air and water.  Now, Earth Day is celebrated in more than 192 countries worldwide as a way for communities to express their environmental concerns and educate others.  Participants engage in activities ranging from tree-planting and cleanup projects to awareness raising concerts and fairs.  In Cambodia, I am encouraged to see that citizens, civil society organizations, and the government are doing their part to raise awareness about preserving the countrys precious and unique environment for future generations.

I can think of no better example of citizens taking action to address environmental concerns than the young people of Cambodia.  In particular, I want to highlight the efforts of the Ambassadors Youth Council (AYC) on addressing Cambodias environmental challenges.  Last year, AYC members visited the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center to learn first-hand about endangered animals in Cambodia and efforts to protect them.  During visits to Mondulkiri and Koh Kong, the members got an in-depth look at the problems of illegal logging and wildlife trafficking and learned how projects that promote sustainable growth not only help rural and forest communities to prosper but also contribute to environmental protection.

Drawing on their knowledge and experience, in January the AYC teamed up with Wildlife Alliance to present a public concert called Wild for Life at the Phnom Penh Night Market.  The event featured musical and comedy performances that provided a platform to entertain and educate more than 3,000 Cambodians on the importance of environmental protection and wildlife conservation.  

Just last month, the AYC hosted another environmental education event.  The Earth Hour program at the Royal University of Phnom Penh, co-organized by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), helped raise awareness about the need to save energy and the impacts of climate change.  The event included a screening of Earth Hour Worldwide and a number of entertaining performances.  It is inspiring to see the many great things the AYC has accomplished in such a short time.  I am optimistic they will achieve even more in the future.

The U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is working with local forest communities in Cambodia to find ways to protect the environment while providing sustainable income.  In partnership with Winrock International and WWF, USAIDs Supporting Forests and Biodiversity Project recently hosted a successful annual forum to spark a dialogue between private investment companies, local communities, and environmentalists in Mondulkiri province.  The forum helped stakeholders explore effective solutions to protect the forests and wildlife.  Another project provided training for women in the village of Kampong Damrey in Kratie province so they can properly manage the surrounding forest resources in ways that benefit the entire community.  We also support the Preak Toal bird sanctuary to protect the Giant Ibis, Cambodias national bird.  With assistance from the U.S. government, members of the surrounding fishing villages have been trained to serve as forest rangers, monitoring and reporting on the bird populations of the sanctuary.  By preserving bird habitats, the rangers are also protecting key fish-spawning grounds that are critical to their economic livelihood.

Meanwhile at the U.S. Embassy, were doing our part as well.  We are implementing green initiatives and educational awareness campaigns that will help us save electricity and reduce waste.  This effort includes switching over from diesel generators to the municipal power grid to reduce air and noise pollution, replacing the halogen lighting system with energy efficient LED lights, and installing water refill stations to reduce the number of plastic water bottles being thrown away.  During the Embassys Earth Day celebration, Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung presented an award to the winner of the Embassys first annual Earth Day Recycled Sculpture Art Contest.  The winning sculpture of a mother and baby elephant, made out of coffee and creamer cups, was selected for the innovative use of recyclable materials.

I hope that you had an opportunity to do something to celebrate Earth Day, but let us not forget that we can engage in activities every day of the year that will help protect the environment, address the impacts of climate change, and combat wildlife trafficking.  By working together, I believe everyone can do their part to make our planet a better place.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I am a firm believer that society benefits when every member is able to lead full and meaningful lives.  However, many individuals with disabilities around the world are unable to thrive because of the discrimination and stigma they encounter.  People with an intellectual disability (ID) in particular, have been largely misunderstood.  Individuals with an ID have certain limitations in cognitive functioning and skills, including communication, social, and self-care skills.  These limitations can cause a child to develop and learn more slowly or differently than a typically developing child.  The most common causes of ID are genetic conditions, complications during pregnancy or birth, and diseases or toxic exposure.  For some individuals, the cause of their ID is unknown.  What is known is that individuals with ID often face barriers that prevent them from fully participating in their community.

Thats why I was pleased to see two events over the past weekend that highlight changing attitudes on the acceptance of individuals with an ID.  On Saturday, the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World Games was held in Los Angeles, California.  And on Sunday, the United States marked the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a law which ensures equal rights to persons with disabilities and prohibits discrimination in all areas of public life.

Founded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the Special Olympics is an organization that changes lives and advances human dignity through sport.  The Special Olympics provide sports training and athletic competition for children and adults with an intellectual disability, giving them opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, and experience joy.  Billed as the worlds largest sports and humanitarian event, people with an ID have been showcasing their athletic abilities to the world since the first Special Olympics in 1968.  Back then, a thousand people from 26 U.S. states and Canada gathered in Chicago, Illinois to compete in track and field, swimming, and floor hockey.  This week, 6,500 athletes and 2,000 coaches representing 165 countries will participate in 25 sports in the biggest athletic gathering in Los Angeles since the 1984 Olympics.

This will be the third time Cambodia has competed in the Special Olympics Summer Games.  Cambodia is represented by a delegation of eight athletes and five coaches and staff at the games and will be competing in the athletics competition and bocce.  I want to recognize the athletes  Uth Sam Ang, Meas Makara, Vorn Sochoulia, Kien Sreypov, Phally Ampor Pich, Thay Sokunthim, Poeung Vuthy, and Rath Samphors  for their dedication and perseverance to become members of Cambodias Special Olympics team.  As you compete to bring home the gold, I want to repeat the Special Olympics oath, Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.

I am proud of the Cambodian Special Olympics athletes, as well as their families and coaches, for their tremendous accomplishment.  I am equally proud of all the people with intellectual disabilities in Cambodia who have participated in the Rural Expansion of Sports initiative, launched last year through a partnership with the Special Olympics, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Royal Government of Cambodia.  This project is helping to recruit and train the next generation of athletes with intellectual disabilities so that they can represent Cambodia at the Special Olympics.  More importantly, this project is giving them an opportunity to participate in a sport as well as their communities.

Through the power of sport, I believe we can enable every member of society to lead full and meaningful lives.  Events like the Special Olympics help foster the acceptance and inclusion of all people.  By working together, I believe we can carry on the spirit of the Special Olympics to change attitudes and create a better world long after the games have ended.

I hope you will join me in cheering for the Cambodian athletes at the Special Olympics.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

In early December 2014, all of us in Cambodia heard the shocking news of a cluster of HIV cases in the Roka village located in Battambang province, affecting both young and old. The Ministry of Health (MOH) quickly and effectively responded to this outbreak, following appropriate procedures that have been put in place over many years. At the same time, the MOH reached out to partners to help investigate and respond to this outbreak. The United States did not hesitate in responding to the MOHs call for support, as part of our committed partnership with Cambodia to reduce the rate of HIV infection in the country. With funding from the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) continue to provide assistance to the Roka community and the entire country. 

 To date, there have been 212 people confirmed to be HIV positive as a result of the collaborative investigation in Roka village. We have actively engaged with the Ministry and other health partners, and there are a number of activities that the U.S. has supported to respond to the recent outbreak. Along with the technical advice that we provided to develop and implement the initial confirmation and investigation of the cluster, counseling and education services are being provided for people who were found HIV positive and the overall community. The local health center receives ongoing support in managing patient care and treatment, including identifying and treating opportunistic infections. We are providing treatment and adherence support through home visits to patients. Assistance is also directed towards laboratory testing and further analysis. 

 Cambodia is a recognized global leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, having been able to rapidly respond to the epidemic by scaling up programs. The tragic situation in the Roka village illustrates the fact that despite Cambodias history of success, it is critically important to remain vigilant in identifying new cases and ensuring a strong health system is in place to respond. The U.S. government has been supporting HIV/AIDS efforts in Cambodia since the mid-1990s, providing more than $200 million dollars. As we look to the future, the United States remains committed to the global HIV/AIDS response and the goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation in Cambodia. Prior to the outbreak, the U.S. government worked with Cambodias National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STDs (NCHADS) to establish a new case management system to actively track recently identified HIV patients and immediately enroll them in care, support, and treatment services. I am encouraged by this and other innovations that will play a vital role in assisting the Roka community and others throughout Cambodia. 

 During my time as U.S. Ambassador, I have been fortunate to have worked with and learned from several individuals dedicated to the fight against HIV/AIDS. Unfortunately, one of these people is departing Cambodia. Dr. Dora Warren, the CDC Country Director since October 2009, will soon begin her new role as CDC Country Director in Burma. During her time in Cambodia, Dr. Warren and her team focused on investigating outbreaks of diseases and cooperated with a wide range Cambodian and international partners to identify effective methods of prevention and treatment. For those of us who have interacted and worked with Dr. Warren, we are well aware of not only her professionalism and expertise; she is also a pleasure to spend time with and has a warm personality. She was dedicated to improving the overall quality of health in Cambodia, and her example served as inspiration for countless others. I want to thank Dr. Warren for her contributions to the Cambodian people and to the U.S. Embassy community. She has truly made a difference and will be greatly missed. 

 I am grateful for the hard work and important contributions of Dr. Warren and others committed to the fight again HIV/AIDS in Cambodia. To the people of the Roka community, we stand with you and will continue to provide support in dealing with the recent outbreak. In response to this tragic situation, I encourage everyone to honor people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. The people of Roka need our compassion and ongoing care more than ever. Furthermore, it is important to recognize the hard work of health workers, scientists, and community members providing assistance. To reach the goal of an AIDS-free generation in Cambodia, we need to learn as much as we can from this recent event and renew our efforts to ensure that something like this does not happen again.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I firmly believe that supporting Cambodias children, from nutrition to health care to education, is the best investment that we can make in this countrys future. The government and the international development community have a big role to play, of course, but charitable giving can also have a significant impact.

I am particularly proud that many U.S. citizens and companies are contributing to this team effort through donations of time, money, and talent to make a positive difference for Cambodias children. One excellent example is John and Cammie Rice  two Americans who are committed to improving education in Cambodia.

On Wednesday morning, Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung represented the Embassy at a ceremony to celebrate the opening of the Rice Academy  a new community-based education facility in Phum Russey run by a fantastic NGO called the  Cambodian Children's Fund (CCF).  The Rice Academy is the result of the support of John and Cammie Rice, who are making a major investment in Cambodias youth. The Rice familys contribution represents the spirit of giving that is an essential part of the character of the United States.

Thanks to their support, CCF will be able to provide quality education, healthcare, nourishment, and safe shelter to nearly 200 children living in one of Phnom Penhs most impoverished areas  and do it in a sustainable way in partnership with the Cambodian government.

All in attendance at the Rice Academy launch were honored by the presence of two forward-looking government leaders: Minister of Education Hang Chuon Naron and Minister of Commerce Sun Chantol. In his remarks, Minister Naron highlighted that supporting education for children requires the attention of not only governments and companies, but that every individual in the community has that responsibility. Mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and grandfathers provide the foundations of love and encouragement. Both ministers have shown their commitment to implement the necessary reforms in their respective ministries to give young Cambodians more of the support they need to succeed in life.

John Rice is the Vice Chairman of General Electric (GE), which is one of the most famous and iconic U.S. companies. Like many U.S. businesses, GE has a long history of contributing to local communities around the world through its corporate social responsibility program. GE is particularly active in Cambodia. Since 2009, GE has contributed more than $9 million dollars in advanced medical equipment to hospitals throughout the country and also provided the necessary training for using the equipment. In Phnom Penh, GE has donated advanced ultra sound equipment, x-ray machines, ventilators, and patient monitors to Calmette Hospital. On Thursday of this week, GE launched its new Safe Water for Cambodian Health Facilities program, which will provide water purification filters, training, and research to improve the quality of water for up to ten hospitals and clinics. GEs contributions are being used every day to save and improve lives of Cambodians.

I would also like to personally thank Scott Neeson, the executive director at CCF, and the many staff and volunteers for their commitment to the children of Cambodia. Scott left a successful career in the film business to dedicate his life to helping Cambodians. During my visit to CCF last year, I learned about the work that the organization is doing to provide quality education and other support services to underprivileged and vulnerable children so they can achieve their potential. Their community-based education model is a success because it also supports the students families. CCF believes that no mother should have to decide between sending her children to school and putting food on the table. I couldnt agree more. CCFs dedication to the children of Cambodia is truly inspirational.

I have no doubt that the Rice Academy will have a powerful and positive impact on the lives of the children of Phum Russey and for the future of Cambodia. There is a Khmer saying tompaing snorng russey, or bamboo shoot is the future bamboo. By helping these eager young bamboo shoots to grow, John and Cammie Rice are building a brighter future for all of Cambodia.

""I really enjoyed meeting Minister of Labor and Vocational Training Ith Samheng today. We had worked together closely in the late 1990s when I was the Economic Officer at the Embassy and #Cambodias garment industry was just getting started. I told the Minister that the United States is committed to working with Cambodia on labor and vocational training issues, and that I was very impressed by the growth of the garment industry over the past 15 years. The large increase in employment, factories, and shipments to America (over $3 billion in 2015) have all been good for Cambodia. The Minister briefed me on the Ministrys very broad reform agenda and important issues like harmonizing industrial relations, implementing the new trade union law, guaranteeing freedom of association, improving the minimum wage setting process, and rolling out a social security labor law.  

To me, the key challenge facing the garment sector today is improving perceptions among Cambodias international partners about conditions in the industry. It will be important to implement the new trade union law fairly and transparently, further refine the minimum wage setting process, settle industrial disputes professionally and fairly, and improve working conditions across the industry. I think Cambodia could make progress on some of these issues quickly, like developing a safer transportation system for garment factory workers and understanding the mass fainting issue better. I look forward to working with the Minister and his team to do just that."" - #AmbHeidt

A recent workshop by the #Cambodia Ministry of Environment called for assistance in exploring the effects of climate change on available groundwater in Cambodia.  Through USAID Cambodia's liaison U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded to the Ministry's need to measure and monitor groundwater resources.

The workshop opening ceremony included U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Program Manager Evan Ting, Ministry of Environment Officials Secretary General H.E. TIN Ponlok and H.E Madam Mey Bouthwithy and #USAID's Andrea Stone. 

            

The event continued with workshop participants from other Ministries and local NGOs conducting a site visit to the Batheay District of Kampong Cham, discussed methods for determining groundwater table at a former mine pit near Cheung Chhnok Village and weighed options for water distribution/treatment techniques at the water tower for the Tang Krang commune.  All involved came away with concepts and tools that can be used to further study the impact of climate change in Cambodia.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Over the last several years, I have spoken often about the many ways my life changed the day my baby girl was born.  I have said how important it is for my daughter to have the same opportunities for happiness and success as my sons.  In continuing with the theme of Womens History Month, I want to talk about a woman who works tirelessly to make a better future for at-risk women and girls  Pok Panhavichet, the Executive Director of the Cambodian Womens Crisis Center (CWCC).  Panhavichet was born in Kandal province and educated in Phnom Penh.  For many years, she has advocated for the rights of women and girls, having worked for the Cambodian government, international development agencies, and local civil society.

CWCC, founded in 1997, helps survivors of domestic violence, rape, and human trafficking recover from the suffering and violence they endured.  I believe the success of CWCC in ensuring the protection of womens rights is best summed up by their motto:  Helping Women Help Themselves.  One of the core functions of CWCC is to provide women and children refuge and support in one of three shelters they operate in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Banteay Meanchey.  The shelters not only provide temporary safe accommodation for women and their children escaping violence, but also offers them medical care and counseling, legal protection, literacy and vocational training skills, and reintegration classes.

Another aspect of CWCCs response to violence against women is their legal assistance program, which aims to empower women to leave abusive or exploitive situations and to provide these women legal advice and support to hold the perpetrators accountable for their violent and criminal actions.  This service is vital, as many of the women are too poor to secure their own legal representation.

Human trafficking is a growing concern in Cambodia, and CWCC is there to assist women and children return to their homes and communities.  The organization has established a program to reduce unsafe migration by conducting campaigns that raise awareness on trafficking.

For years, CWCC has been at the forefront of changing peoples attitudes on violence against women.  They have partnered with government officials to provide training for police officers and local authorities to help them recognize and enforce the laws that protect the rights of women and children in rural communities across the country.  In nearly two decades of operations, CWCC has helped almost 20,000 people escape from suffering and rebuild their lives.  I want to thank Panhavichet for her outstanding leadership of CWCC and her commitment to empowering the victims of violence and human trafficking in Cambodia to build better lives for themselves and their children.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

With mobile phone penetration in Cambodia reaching over 90% of the population, there is tremendous opportunity for Cambodians to learn more about the positions and platforms of the political parties that want their votes.  One tool that can take advantage of the extensive use of mobile phones is Interactive Voice Response (IVR).  This tool is a great way to improve access to information for Cambodian voters  and thats why the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is funding the use of IVR for Cambodias political parties.

Last week my deputy attended a workshop organized by USAIDs Accountability in Governance and Politics (AGAP) program to highlight the use of IVR technology with the political parties.  I was glad to see that most of the participants were from the youth wings of five parties  Cambodian Peoples Party (CPP); Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP); FUNCINPEC; Republic Democratic Party (RDP); and League for Democracy Party (LDP).

I understand that these five political parties established IVR platform hotlines in August of this year, and in the eight weeks since then, the hotlines have received over 17,000 calls.  The interest being generated among Cambodians is terrific, demonstrating the unprecedented potential of information technology to enable political parties to more effectively reach and mobilize the citizenry. Anyone can call the hotlines to find out more about each partys priorities, policies, and leadership.

The IVR workshop is a perfect example of how Cambodians are using technology to further expand democratic participation and become an informed electorate.  It also reminds me of the great success of the voter education IVR program that was established in the run-up to the 2013 parliamentary elections.  That one generated over 600,000 calls!

I am proud of the United States contributions to promoting technology and innovative tools to further democratic development.  Through the AGAP program, we are actively supporting political competition and promoting the accountability of elected leaders with activities like the IVR platform hotlines.  We also support constituency dialogues, womens forums, and leadership trainings.  These activities are designed to increase political party effectiveness and give the electorate a greater voice in the political parties.  

In addition, through the USAID-funded Development Innovations program, we support a Social Innovation Lab as a gathering place and learning center for the tech community.  The Lab is helping promote the use of technology to meet Cambodias development challenges by connecting resources with those in civil society and the private sector who most need to harness new technologies.

I encourage Cambodias political parties  small and large, old and new  to continue using technology, like the IVR hotlines, to provide information to voters.  Establishing ways for citizens to interact with the political parties and relay their concerns improves the sharing of information and strengthens democracy.  The potential for expanding the use of technology to promote Cambodias democratic development are limitless  so I hope you take advantage of it!

Climate change is a complex issue with global implications, but sometimes it is a small indicator of this threat that hits the closest to home.  This past weekend, there was a heavy rain storm over Phnom Penh, and the neighborhood around the U.S. Embassy flooded.  Close to a meter of water made it impossible to navigate the streets.  I later saw in the newspapers that the rising water flooded many peoples homes and damaged their property.  As higher frequency and greater intensity of severe weather events are linked to global warming, the dramatic flooding was a small but clear reminder of the impact of climate change and the importance of working together to address it.

Did you know? American people, technically, do not vote directly for the president and vice president.

When they cast their vote, they are actually voting for a group of people known as electors.

This indirect election system, called the Electoral College, reflects the federal governing system of allocating powers to a national government representing not only the people but also the states.

The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors.

Each elector casts one electoral vote following the general election. The candidate that gets more than half (270) wins the election.

A minimum wage that is determined through a fair and transparent process based on scientific research and international standards is critical for a healthy economy, and workers and management both benefit when workers receive such protections.  Importantly, our emphasis is not so much on a specific number but rather on the methodology that is used to determine the minimum wage.  As Cambodia seeks to become a destination of choice for international companies, it is important to recognize that international brands must carefully guard their image, which in turn depend on the image of the factories and countries from which they source their products.  Cambodias reputation and practices with respect to labor rights and working conditions in the textile factories, therefore, matter greatly.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Today, we live in an increasingly mobile world where people have the ability to travel to a different continent in a matter of hours.  However, this also means that diseases can cross borders and oceans as freely as humans.  The people of Cambodia are its greatest asset and a healthy population is critical to the countrys economic development.  Keeping everyone around the world and in Cambodia healthy requires international cooperation.  Im proud that the U.S. government is committed to helping the Cambodian people have a healthy future.  Roughly one half of our development assistance in Cambodia is dedicated to health programs that are combatting diseases such as malaria, and weve seen some tremendous successes in recent years.

Our efforts to improve the health of Cambodians involve more than just development agencies.  Last week, Lieutenant General Patricia Horoho, U.S. Army Surgeon General and Commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command, visited Cambodia to assess U.S. military research units in the country and to discuss bilateral cooperation between the United States and Cambodia on a variety of health issues.  Lieutenant General Horoho is the first woman and first nurse to ever hold the title of Surgeon General in the 239-year history of the U.S. Army.

Along the Cambodia-Thailand border north of Siem Reap, Lieutenant General Horoho reviewed the bilateral malaria control activities of the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), one of the U.S. Armys premier research units, and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF).  The border area is currently home to a strain of malaria resistant individuals to some of the most powerful and effective drugs available.  In partnership with Cambodias National Malaria Center (NMC) and the RCAF, AFRIMS has been working to build research capacity and conduct high quality biomedical research in Cambodia to develop new drugs to fight the spread of malaria.  

In Phnom Penh, Lieutenant General Horoho toured the laboratories of the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit-2 Detachment (NAMRU-2), which work with NMC and other government health offices to conduct research and surveillance detection for malaria and other infectious diseases.  Lieutenant General Horoho also met with Cambodian health officials, toured the RCAF Health Science Institute, and visited the Preah Ket Mealea Army Hospital.

During her visit, Lieutenant General Horoho also took time to talk about the Armys new wellness campaign, the Performance Triad as it is called, which emphasizes getting quality sleep, engaging in activity, and improving nutrition.  By taking these steps to take care of ourselves, we can improve our health to be able to lead productive, long, and happy lives.  After all, as the saying goes, Your health is your greatest wealth.

I want to thank Lieutenant General Horoho for her visit to highlight the continuing collaboration between the United States and Cambodia in the effort to improve the health of the Cambodian people.  By partnering with RCAF and Cambodias government health sector, the U.S. military complements the efforts of other U.S. government agencies in the Kingdom to assist Cambodians to lead healthy lives.  I would also like to recognize the Lieutenant General for being an excellent role model for girls to pursue a career in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Her rise to become the U.S. Army Surgeon General, the highest-ranking position in the Armys medical department, is a tribute to her hard work and dedication.  I hope that more girls and young women, especially here in Cambodia, will consider a career in the STEM fields.

A joint statement expressing concern about the human rights situation in Cambodia was issued today at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, Switzerland. The statement was read by U.S. Ambassador to the UNHRC Keith Harper on behalf of Albania, Australia, Canada, Japan, Macedonia, Norway, Switzerland, the 28 EU member states, and the United States.

       Keith Harper            

The statement reads in part: We are deeply concerned about the current escalation of political tensions in Cambodia, which threatens legitimate activities by opposition parties and human rights NGOs.  There is particular concern about the appearance that legal action is being disproportionately pursued against critics of the government. We are equally concerned about the status of culture of dialogue between the two main political parties, which has ceased to function. We lament the recent murder of commentator and analyst Kem Ley and note the chilling effect this crime has had upon civil society and independent voices in Cambodia.

                  

The statement also reiterates previous calls by UN Special Rapporteurs to to ensure a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders and civil society, which play a critical role in holding the Government to account and bringing benefits of human rights to the whole of Cambodian society.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Muslims around the world are observing Ramadan, Islams holiest month, which started last week.  During this period of reflection and renewal, Muslims fast from dawn until sunset daily to increase their thankfulness and consciousness of Gods mercy.  This time is also characterized by the act of giving  Muslims reach out to assist those afflicted by conflict, hunger, poverty, and disease.  Here in Cambodia, the Cham Muslim minority are also observing Ramadan, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.  During my tenure as Ambassador to Cambodia, I have made it a priority for the U.S. Embassy to build connections and strengthen the bonds of friendship with every community in Cambodia, including the Cham Muslim population.

Throughout the year, the U.S. Embassy engages with Cambodian Muslims in an effort to help strengthen their communities through a number of programs.  For example, we have hosted Iftar events for the Muslim community to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the conclusion of Ramadan.  Our English Access Microscholarship Program provides opportunities to hundreds of Cambodian students each year  particularly in Islamic communities  to improve their English language skills.  In a previous blog, I wrote about how the English Access program enabled Afiny Math to find employment using her English skills to build a brighter future for herself and her family.

Additionally, we have promoted the themes of religious tolerance and anti-violence in youth-oriented Peace Concerts held throughout the country.  Tens of thousands of Cambodians attended the concerts this year in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, and Tboung Khmum provinces.  Our Muslim Dialogue Program allows Cambodian Muslims to participate in workshops with guest speakers from throughout Southeast Asia.  The workshops focus on a variety of key topics, including interfaith cooperation, womens empowerment, community leadership, and conflict resolution.  The U.S. Embassy also supports Cham Muslim heritage through the publication of Mukva  a periodical written in both the Khmer and Cham languages.  This periodical is the first of its kind in Cambodia and provides information and stories relevant to the Cham Muslim population, helping to preserve an important component of Cambodias cultural and linguistic heritage.

These are just a few of the many U.S.-sponsored programs that are helping Cambodian Muslims to develop skills and gain knowledge that will help them achieve their goals in life and contribute positively to their communities and to Cambodian society.  I look forward to continuing to strengthen these bonds of friendship and cooperation with the Muslim community in Cambodia.

Finally, I would like to extend a Ramadan Kareem to all Muslims this month.  I hope this Ramadan is filled with blessings for you and your families.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

I recently spoke with members of my team at the U.S. Embassy about their visit to the Phnom Penh office of Friends International.  Some of my readers may already be familiar with this award-winning international NGO, which was established in Cambodia in 1994 and its local NGO known as Mith Samlanh (friends in English).  Today, Friends International works with young people and their families in four different continents.  Among the long list of innovative programs and activities that my team learned about and observed in practice was how Friends International utilizes a social business model to support youth development in Cambodia.  By offering vocational training, employment, and other means for generating income, their social businesses provides an opportunity for both the young people and the organization to receive high social and financial returns.  While empowering youth, Friends International is also helping them to become more actively involved in improving the lives of others in Cambodia.

When Nobel Prize Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus developed the social business model, he envisioned an enterprise that would be driven by more than just the goal of financial gain.  He once said, Business is a very beautiful mechanism to solve problems, but we never use it for that purpose. We only use it to make money.  It satisfies our selfish interest but not our collective interest.  The impact that the business has on people and their communities  not the amount of profit made in a given period  is what measures the success of a social business.  While financial profit may still be an objective, those funds are used to assist others, creating products and supporting programs that have a social purpose.  Here in Cambodia, more people are seeing the potential for the establishment and expansion of social business, and organizations like Friends International are sharing best practices that have begun to spread throughout the country. 

To ensure the organizations sustainability, Friends International operates a wide range of income generating activities.  Here in Cambodia, they have restaurants, a beauty salon, and other training businesses that give students from their Vocational Training Center the chance to gain experience in real business environments.  Parents are also given instruction on how to start their own social businesses so that they can earn income and send their children to school instead of having them work on the streets.  These activities also help the organization generate profit, with the money being used to fund additional projects that benefit youth and their families.  In fact, Mith Samlanh is able to fund more than half of its own financial needs directly with the income that comes from these social business ventures.

I have spoken before about the strong commitment that the U.S. Embassy has for individuals and organizations that support innovation, youth development, and economic empowerment in Cambodia.  We promote entrepreneurship not only as a means of expanding Cambodias middle class; socially responsible business can also play a valuable role in solving problems and advancing progress in the country.  While Friends International is a nongovernmental organization with a social purpose at the heart of its mission, the notion of social responsibility can be expanded throughout civil society and the business sector.  This is why Im especially proud of USAIDs support for this organization. From small and medium enterprises to large multinationals, more companies are emphasizing the importance of social responsible business practices in the economic development of Cambodia.  I would like to commend the efforts of organizations like Friends International, which is taking a lead role in helping others understand and utilize socially responsible business.  They serve as a remarkable example of how an innovative business model can be financially successful in Cambodia, all while having a positive social impact on the entire country.  

Do you have ideas about socially responsible business practices in Cambodia?  If so, please share your comments.

Pan Sorasak, and Chairman of GMAC - Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia Mr. Van Sou Leng welcomed the expansion as an opportunity to increase exports and create up to 100,000 jobs in Cambodia.  

This announcement has the potential to open up an entirely new market for Cambodian exporters and to create thousands of jobs for Cambodians,"" says #AmbHeidt. ""We encourage Cambodian manufacturers to take advantage of this new opportunity, which would help to diversify Cambodias economic base, spur economic growth, and alleviate poverty.

-The Ambassador's Penh

Last night, I was delighted to host the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia  better known as AmCham  for their monthly networking event.  It was a wonderful opportunity for the Cambodian business community, special guests, and members of the U.S. Embassy to meet one another, to learn about recent activities of the vibrant business community here, and to discuss ways we can work together.  We had a great turnout with over 200 guests representing the private sector and NGOs who came to network and develop new relationships for doing business in Cambodia.  Acleda Bank, Samaritans Purse, Visa, and the Cambodia Women Entrepreneurs Association represent some of the diverse guests who attended the event. 

The U.S. Embassys partnership with AmCham has played a critical role in our efforts to expand U.S. trade and investment in Cambodia.  Over the last two years, I have traveled with AmCham on two reverse trade missions to the United States and three regional trade missions to Thailand and Singapore.  We have also co-hosted a webinar on doing business in Cambodia and worked together on AmCham-sponsored roundtables that featured such speakers as Minister of Commerce Sun Chanthol and Minister of Education Hang Chuon Naron.  As I emphasized last night, Amcham members can be confident that my U.S. Embassy team is an advocate for building and expanding their outreach.

I am pleased we are starting to see the fruits of our cooperation.  More and more American companies are looking at increasing trade and investing in Cambodia.  Earlier this year Tiffany & Co., an iconic American jewelry company, opened a diamond-polishing factory in Cambodia.  Several other large U.S. companies are planning to start operations next year.

I want to thank everyone who attended the AmCham networking event.  Your presence made the night a tremendous success.  With your help, we can continue to attract new American companies, expand bilateral trade, and support investment in Cambodia.

AmCham and its members deserve considerable credit for the work they do to create a more secure and prosperous future for the people of the United States and Cambodia.  Amcham provides its members with a template for developing successful and efficient business methods, corporate social responsibility programs, ethical commercial practices, and nurturing future leaders through internship opportunities.  Are you interested in learning more about the role of AmCham in Cambodia or becoming a member?

On November 14, Prince Norodom Sihanouk returns to Cambodia after 13 years in exile. He rides from the airport into Phnom Penh in a 1963 Chevrolet Impala convertible, as a large crowd lines the road, cheering and waving flags. Later that month, the city celebrates its first water festival  one of the biggest celebrations on the Khmer calendar  since 1969.

1991: In November, the United States restores diplomatic relations with Cambodia, ends economic sanctions, and resumes development assistance. On November 11, a U.S. liaison office opens in Phnom Penh and Charles H. Twining is appointed U.S. Representative. By 1992, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) re-opens its permanent mission to Cambodia, and the agencys total budget for the decade reaches $264 million. U.S. assistance 
re-opens National Road 4, which was originally built by the United States in the 1950s and runs from Phnom Penh to the countrys only deep-water port, Sihanoukville.

1992: The UN Transition Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) takes over administration of Cambodia. U.S. assistance pays for 30% of UNTACs budget and supports its mandate of establishing a freely elected government. Leading the mission is Yasushi Akashi, a senior UN diplomat in charge of 16,000 soldiers and 5,000 civilians. Two of these civilian advisors, American diplomat Timothy Carney and American academic Stephen Heder, supervise the opening of Cambodias first free press since 1972 and create Radio UNTAC, a popular source of unbiased information in Khmer.

1993: On May 28, 90% of Cambodians ignore threats of violence and vote in the countrys first democratic election, surpassing even the most hopeful predictions. FUNCINPEC party receives 45% of the vote, while CPP receives 38%. In September, the newly formed Constituent Assembly approves a constitution, and Norodom Sihanouk is crowned King. He appoints Prince Ranariddh as First Prime Minister and Hun Sen as Second Prime Minister.

1998: On April 15, Pol Pot dies of natural causes in a jungle camp near the Thai border. His body is cremated on a funeral pyre made of tires. The Khmer Rouge, which had been dwindling in numbers due to defections of key leaders, perishes with him. President Clinton who was in Chile at the time, issues a
written statement noting that ''Although the opportunity to hold Pol Pot accountable for his monstrous crimes appears to have passed, senior Khmer Rouge, who exercised leadership from 1975 to 1979, are still at large and share responsibility for the monstrous human rights abuses committed during this period. We must not permit the death of the most notorious of the Khmer Rouge leaders to deter us from the equally important task of bringing these others to justice.''

Pictured below are three outstanding women who are studying for careers in technology: Heng Somphas, Chea Sovannara (Information Technology, Thammasat University, Bangkok), and Chhin Chileap (Information and Communication Engineering, ITC). They're among a growing number of female university students with tech-related majors.  All three are currently serving as interns as they prepare to graduate and move on to exciting high-tech careers.

Somphas, Sovannara, and Chileap are following in the footsteps of other women pioneers. In his recent visit to the Pactics factory in Siem Reap, #AmbHeidt met Huonh Chun and Pour Choun, who both studied for two years at the National Polytechnic Institute of Cambodia in Phnom Penh.  Chun and Choun are currently finishing their probationary period at Pactics and will soon be working as Industrial Engineers for the company!

Not only did SSgt Dara serve as support staff and translator for the team; since he grew up in Phnom Penh he was a cultural liaison during courses and exercises, helping to amplify the lessons taught by the instructors. The team's chief said, SSgt Dara is a real force multiplier, hugely contributing to this missions success.""

SSgt Dara moved to the United States when he was 16 years old with his father, mother and older brother. Growing up in Lowell, Massachusetts, he graduated high school in 2004, attended college, and decided to join the Air Force in 2007. He has excelled in his military service, earning the title of distinguished graduate for Civil Engineering, serving two tours in Afghanistan, achieving high language proficiency through the Language Enabled Airman Program, and his recent promotion to the rank of E-6. Please join the U.S. Embassy in thanking SSgt Dara for his service - both to the United States and to Cambodia.",2016-08-05,64.0

Throughout International Education Week (November 17-21), the U.S. Embassy will highlight a different U.S. government-sponsored exchange program each day!

We will start with the oldest and most famous (and most competitive) of all of our exchange programs -- the Fulbright Foreign Student Program, which was started in 1946.  The Fulbright Foreign Student Program enables graduate students from abroad to study and conduct research in the United States at U.S. universities or other appropriate institutions -- usually for two years.  In Cambodia, the application period begins around June, approximately 15 months before the beginning of the academic program.

There are currently 14 Cambodians participating in the Fulbright Foreign Student Program in the United States.  Sivhoang Chea from Phnom Penh is a recent graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles.  According to Sivhoang:  ""Through the Fulbright program I obtained my Master degree in Law (LL.M) in 2014, specializing in international law.  Two years ago, I had a career dream to participate in finding justice for Cambodian people who have suffered under the Khmer Rouge Regime.  Two months after graduation, I was employed as an associate legal officer in the Trial Chamber at the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.  Without the Fulbright program, I would not have achieved the dream I once had!""

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Like many people in Cambodia, I was delighted to learn that the Water Festival would take place this year after a three-year hiatus.  The tragedy of 2010 should never be forgotten, but it is important that this great tradition continue now and long into the future.

I had the high honor to attend the opening ceremony of the 2014 Water Festival in the presence of His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni on Wednesday afternoon, along with the Prime Minister and leaders from the National Assembly.  It was a delight to see the boats race gracefully down the river, much as they have for hundreds of years.  I also enjoyed some Ak Ambok, which I ate with banana and coconut juice.  It was a delicious treat!

The Cambodian Water Festival  or Bon Om Tuk  began as a way to honor the naval forces under King Jayvarman VII and to express profound thanks to the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers.  Today, the rivers continue to be the life blood of Cambodia, providing food and jobs for millions.  Water Festival is an opportunity to consider the importance of rivers to Cambodians and to rededicate ourselves to protecting this precious resource.

The Water Festival in Phnom Penh is the biggest and best known in all of Cambodia, but Water Festivals are taking place across the country in towns big and small.  There is even a Water Festival in Lowell, Massachusetts, which is home to a large and active Cambodian community.  Although Water Festival in Cambodia takes place in October or November, the one in Lowell takes place in August when the weather is warm.

I hope that all of my readers have a wondrous Water Festival.  If you are coming to Phnom Penh from out of town, I wish you safe travels.  I would also like to congratulate all Cambodians on the 61st anniversary of your independence, on November 9.  I wish everyone peace and happiness as we celebrate this important day.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

In previous blogs, I have highlighted the tireless efforts of Youk Chhang and the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam), which works to document Khmer Rouge atrocities while helping Cambodians reconcile with their past and move towards a brighter future.  With the worlds largest repository of documents and other original materials related to the Khmer Rouge era, DC-Cam has contributed to a number of research projects, education and outreach programs, and even the legal cases against former Khmer Rouge leaders.  Now, thanks in large part to DC-Cam, even more people around the world can learn about Cambodias history.

This week, in partnership with DC-Cam, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. inaugurated two special exhibits on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge.  As one of the worlds most important museums related to genocide, the Holocaust Museums education and outreach programs have helped inspire citizens worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity.  Although the museum focuses on the Holocaust  the mass murder of six million Jewish people in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s  it also hosts special exhibits on other mass atrocities, such as those which occurred during Khmer Rouge era.

While I could not attend the opening in person, my good friend and colleague Ambassador Scot Marciel, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, was there to represent the State Department and provide opening remarks.  He noted that the exhibits  like the work of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal and all those who strive to ensure that these tragic events are remembered  will continue to be essential for Cambodians, Americans, and the rest of the world to understand this past and move towards a brighter future.

The two exhibits  Cambodia 19751979 and I Want Justice!  explore the cruel actions taken by the Khmer Rouge and the international communitys efforts to pursue justice for the victims and hold accountable those responsible for these crimes.  In the Cambodia 19751979 exhibit, museum visitors learn about the terror of the Khmer Rouge era through historical photographs, film, and contemporary art that depict the regimes establishment of its Democratic Kampuchea forty years ago.  By some estimates, up to two million Cambodians died as a result of execution, starvation, exhaustion, or disease during this four year period.  The exhibit features images of Phnom Penhs two million residents being driven out of the city within hours and sent to the countryside, where they were quickly pressed into forced labor brigades on massive earthworks and rice paddies.  Visitors will experience a profound sadness when observing this exhibit, but for many Cambodians, these tragic events of the past are at times impossible to view.

However, in the I Want Justice! exhibit, visitors can find out about the current efforts to hold perpetrators of genocide and mass atrocities accountable through court proceedings, including the ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal (KRT)  for which the U.S. government has provided millions of dollars in contributions each year.  The exhibit also looks at ways Cambodian survivors are seeking other forms of justicepersonal, cultural, historicalas they continue to struggle with the legacy of the murderous Khmer Rouge era.  With its extensive outreach and educational programming to help Cambodians and the rest of the world understand the history of the Khmer Rouge, it is no surprise that DC-Cam played a significant role in bringing the exhibit to the United States and helping people to heal.

The exhibits will run through October 2017, giving people an opportunity to learn about a critical part of Cambodias history and reflect on what it means today.  The website of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum also features details about the exhibits for those interested in learning more about Cambodias history.  I encourage more people  especially youth  to take the time to learn more about the mistakes of the past so that they are not repeated in the future.  The crimes that occurred during the Khmer Rouge era are almost too horrific to mention, but the stories of the victims must continue to be told lest we forget.

On Sunday, Professor Pallant and the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) team had another full day of activities.  They started the morning by visiting the Royal University of Agriculture (RUA) in Phnom Penh where Professor Pallant delivered a seminar on River Rehabilitation to 50 university students.  The students showed strong interest in the topic by asking tough questions and sharing what they were learning.  

After the seminar, the team and Professor Pallant were escorted by RUA faculty and staff to learn about an aquaponics experiment being conducted by RUA students.  Aquaponics is the method of growing crops and fish together in a re-circulating system. The water from the fish tank is filtered and then used in a hydroponic farming system, where the plants are not in soil but get their nutrients from water.  As the water leaves the hydroponic system, it flows back into the fish tank.  

The team then headed to one of Phnom Penhs four water treatment plants, this one located in northern Phnom Penh.  In coordination with the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA), Professor Pallant and the YSEALI team got to see the water treatment process up close and understand how PPWSA treats the undrinkable water from the river in order to supply clean water to households in Phnom Penh. 

Monday is Professor Pallants last day in Cambodia before he continues his three-country Streams of Hope River Rehabilitation Speaker Tour in the Philippines, and then on to Vietnam.  

Professor Eric Pallant, Chair of the Environmental Science Department at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania, USA, is visiting Cambodia, the Philippines, and Vietnam to help the three-country YSEALI team with their Streams of Hope project. Members from Cambodia, the Philippines, and Vietnam joined together to focus on maintaining clean water resources in the region. As part of the U.S. Department of States Speaker Program, Professor Pallant is meeting with high school and university students, members of civil society, government officials, and others who have a stake in maintaining clean water resources.

You can follow Professor Pallants trip throughout the region on Facebook. He is in Cambodia until September 15, then he will be in Manila for three days where you can follow him on U.S. Embassy, Manila Philippines Facebook page, and then on to Hanoi for three days where you can follow him on the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi Facebook page.

You can also follow Dr. Pallants trip via Twitter with #StreamsOfHope.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

If you are reading this blog, you probably have access to a computer and have a Facebook account.  Cambodians are increasingly connected online, and the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia is proud to be a small part of this technological revolution.  

When I began my service as the U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia, our Facebook page had just over 25,000 fans.  Today, a third of 1 million fans along with more than 34,000 Twitter followers  prove that Cambodians want to connect with us and receive news about the programs we support.  Furthermore, it shows that people want to participate in dialogue on important issues in the country.  All of you who have commented on our Facebook page, responded on my blog, or have sent me questions for my weekly Ask the Ambassador column, have greatly contributed to the valuable conversations we are having about Cambodias future.

Today, the Internet provides unprecedented reach and freedom for people to gather information and express their opinions.  Even more important, this technology is interactive, allowing users to select the content they find most useful and relevant in their lives.  This ability to access accurate and independent information is the engine of a free and democratic society.  Despite low access to the Internet in several parts of the country, the fact that so many Cambodians are taking advantage of online resources when they are available is an indication of their desire to be well-informed, active participants in the countrys growing democracy.    

With 1.23 billion users across the world, Facebook has become an increasingly important way of obtaining information not only about friends and family, but also about world events.  Along with Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms, social media is having a tremendous impact on the way Cambodians are receiving and sharing information about what is happening in the country and around the globe.  The attraction of social media is that it enables a two-way dialogue, something that is not possible with traditional media.  This form of communication has continued to grow in significance and now serves as a powerful tool for soliciting ideas and feedback on the issues that matter to Cambodians, particularly with young people.

Social media has provided a large number of Cambodian youth with opportunities to express their views about the countrys development.  With one of the youngest populations in Southeast Asia, Cambodias hope for the future lies in the minds and the lives of these young people.  The number of Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, and YouTube videos being created in Cambodia represents the desire for knowledge and innovation by young Cambodians.  This intellectual curiosity is a great equalizer when it comes to competing for opportunities in the country, throughout the ASEAN region, and across the world.  Therefore, along with face-to-face outreach, the U.S. Embassy works hard to connect with youth via social media, posting content that appeals to young Cambodians and making an effort to respond to their questions and comments. 

When the U.S. Embassy promotes its social media platforms, it is not to compete with other individuals or organizations to see who can get the most fans.  Whether you choose to follow your favorite singer, news source, or a public official; we support a free and democratic society in Cambodia which allows its people to access and select content from the Internet and other media of their choosing.  The reason why we seek your support is because every time that you like and share our Facebook posts or retweet our Twitter content, you help us reach more users.  This gives more Cambodians access to information about education, exchanges, President Obamas Young Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative (YSEALI), English language learning, and a host of other programs.  So while 333,333 is remarkable (and a very lucky number), this is only the beginning.

Our next goal is to reach 500,000 Facebook fans.  Would you like to help us achieve this next milestone?  We will do our part by making sure our Facebook page is a source of meaningful, noteworthy and helpful information, and you can assist us by letting all of your friends know that we invite them to join our online family.  With our combined efforts, I am confident that we will make it to 500,000 Facebook fans and beyond.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgbguv0Olvw

Transcript:

""Over the past few days, I think all of us have been shaken by the images of the devastation wrought by Typhoon Haiyan.

Its a heartbreaking reminder of how fragile life is, and among the dead are several Americans.

So our prayers are with the Filipino people, and with Filipino Americans across our country who are anxious about their family and friends back home.

One of our core principles is, when friends are in trouble, America helps.

As I told President Aquino earlier this week, the United States will continue to offer whatever assistance we can.

Our military personnel and USAID team do this better than anybody in the world, and theyve been already on the ground working tirelessly to deliver food, water, medicine, shelter, and to help with airlift.

Today, the aircraft carrier USS George Washington and other ships arrived to help with search-and-rescue, as well as supplies, medical care and logistical support. And more help is on the way.

Americas strength, of course, has always been more than just about what our government can do  its also about what our citizens can do. 

Its about the big-heartedness of the American people when they see other folks in trouble.

So today, I would encourage everybody who wants to help, to visit WhiteHouse.gov/typhoon -- that's WhiteHouse.gov/typhoon -- and that will offer you links to organizations that are working on the ground and ways that you can support their efforts.

Our friends in the Philippines will face a long, hard road ahead, but theyll continue to have a friend and partner in the United States of America.""",2013-11-15,

Ambassador William E. Todd attended the Inaugural Session of the Fifth Legislature of the National Assembly today under the patronage of His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni.  His attendance is not an endorsement of any election outcome or of any political party.

The United States urges a transparent review of irregularities in the July 28 national elections which would help efforts to assess and address flaws in the electoral process and give the Cambodian people greater confidence in the electoral system.

We believe that a functioning National Assembly requires the participation of both major political parties.  We call on the two parties to follow through on their September 16 joint statement denouncing violence, supporting discussion of electoral reforms, and agreeing to resolve national problems through dialogue. 

All parties should seize this opportunity to improve democratic processes and implement meaningful reforms which strengthen the rule of law and increase respect for human rights.  The United States urges the party leaders to work together for an outcome that unites the country and best serves the Cambodian people.

Today, the Royal Government of Cambodia announced a prohibition on all public demonstrations in and around Phnom Penh.  Separately, the main political opposition party has stated it intends to conduct a mass rally and march through Phnom Penh on Sunday, January 5, 2014.  There is a potential for violence should security forces attempt to disperse demonstrations in the capital over the next several days.  Based on the governments handling of past protests, the U.S. Embassy anticipates that major roads into Phnom Penh will be blocked and significant restrictions on vehicular movements will be imposed within the city, resulting in severe traffic disruptions coming into and throughout Phnom Penh.  The Embassy recommends that U.S citizens within Phnom Penh limit any unnecessary travel away from their residences and avoid large crowds and immediately leave any area where crowds are gathering.  U.S. citizens outside of Phnom Penh should expect significant delays traveling into the city.  The Embassy also notes that violence, including fatalities, has occurred at roadblocks in the recent past.  You should remain alert to local security developments by monitoring local news reports, be vigilant regarding your personal security and preparedness, be aware of your surroundings, and plan your activities accordingly.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

A large number of readers of my blog have given positive feedback about my goal to feature more Cambodian civil society organizations and leaders who are making significant contributions for the betterment of their fellow citizens.  For this entry, I want to recognize the efforts of Mr. Thun Saray, President of the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association  also known by many in Cambodia and around the world as ADHOC.  Since its founding in December 1991 by a group of former political prisoners after the signing of the Paris Peace Agreement, ADHOC has become one of the most influential NGOs in the country, working to promote respect for human rights in Cambodia through monitoring, legal assistance, and community empowerment.

Thun Saray was a political prisoner on two separate occasions  including under the Khmer Rouge regime.  After his release from prison, he turned his attention to becoming a human rights activist, focusing on basic rights, freedoms, and liberties in Cambodia.  With a career that has endured for more than 20 years championing these areas, Thun Saray has become a well-respected defender of human rights.  Along with his role as the President of ADHOC, he is also the President of the Board of Directors of the Committee for Free and Fair Elections (COMFREL) in Cambodia and a member of the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee Board of Directors.

With his recognition in both local and international circles, Thun Saray has helped ADHOC become a vital and respected member of Cambodias civil society.  Under his leadership, ADHOC has organized non-violent demonstrations to preserve political space and called for the release of imprisoned human rights activists.  While its headquarters are located in Phnom Penh, the organization has branch offices throughout the provinces.  Recently, my Deputy Chief of Mission visited the ADHOC office in Kampong Cham, meeting with the representatives about their local advocacy for labor rights and civic participation.  Some of ADHOCs initiatives include the Human Rights Monitoring Program, the Land and Natural Resources Rights Program, the Womens and Childrens Rights Program, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal Project, and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Project. 

With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), another noteworthy program that ADHOC has implemented is called Empowering Marginalized Communities.   This initiative looks to strengthen marginalized communities through legal and advocacy activities to obtain fairer redress for victims of human rights abuses.  Furthermore, these activities seek to improve inclusive participation in, and monitoring of, the communal development process.  The project began in January 2015 and will be implemented in 16 Cambodian provinces over three years, reaching 150 target communities.  In the first three months, ADHOC staff has provided capacity-building trainings, conducted 200 sensitization courses, and identified 50 target communities.  As the project continues, we can look forward to seeing more community members with knowledge about their rights and the law, enhanced solidarity between communities, greater protection for community representatives and activists, the discovery of fair and peaceful solutions to human rights violations, and the promotion of inclusive participation of community members in the decision-making process in Cambodia.

Under the leadership of Thun Saray, I am confident ADHOC will continue to play a prominent role in promoting human rights in Cambodia.  I applaud the important example that he has set for all who are working towards a better tomorrow for the country.  For more information about the great work that ADHOC is doing in Cambodia, I encourage you to go to their website.  As with so many civil society leaders, Thun Saray displays a passion for progress and is helping to instill that passion in others.  I look forward to continuing our efforts to support his essential work with ADHOC and other civil society organizations that are helping to promote and protect human rights in Cambodia.

1962: The International Court of Justice in The Hague rules in favor of Cambodia in a dispute with Thailand over Preah Vihear, an 11th century temple located in a disputed area near the Thai border. Former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson successfully represents Cambodia in the case, which many observers had predicted would see Thailand prevail. After the verdict, Prince Norodom Sihanouk proclaims a seven-day national holiday and the country erupts into mass celebrations.

1965: With the conflict escalating in Vietnam, border incursions into eastern Cambodia increase and result in civilian casualties. Prince Sihanouk fears for his countrys territorial integrity and seeks assurances from both the United States and communist governments. His political power is further threatened by dissident groups. Meanwhile, the United States claims that the Cambodian military is cooperating with Viet Cong forces. Unable to resolve their grievances, the United States and Cambodia officially sever diplomatic ties in May. Relations are not restored until the end of the decade.

1967: Jacqueline Kennedy visits Cambodia in November as a personal guest of Prince Sihanouk. A crowd of 10,000 greets her at Pochentong Airport in Phnom Penh, including girls strewing jasmine petals in a traditional Buddhist welcome. During her trip, the former First Lady fulfills a lifelong dream of visiting Angkor Wat. She is the first American to be received with high state honors since ties were broken, signaling a promising turn in the relationship.

1969: President Richard M. Nixon orders a covert bombing campaign of eastern Cambodia. Operation Menu lasts 14 months and results in the release of some 2,756,941 tons of ordnance. Nixon authorizes the bombings in an attempt to thwart Viet Cong forces, which by 1970 occupy between a fifth and a third of Cambodian territory. The campaign does not become known to the American public until 1973.

1969: Diplomatic relations are restored. The U.S. Embassy reopens on August 16, with Lloyd M. Rives acting as Charg dAffaires ad interim and a staff of eight. Later that month, in an effort to demonstrate Washingtons renewed commitment to Cambodia, U.S. Senator Mike Mansfield visits Phnom Penh for the third time in seven years. During the visit, Prince Sihanouk calls the Senator one of the greatest and most loyal friends to Cambodia.

-From the Ambassodor's Penh

This year, Ive made it my goal to highlight Cambodian civil society leaders who are making significant contributions for the betterment of their fellow citizens.  Thats why I was so delighted when Chak Sopheap, Executive Director of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR), was recognized by President Barack Obama during his speech at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City on September 23rd.  He praised Sopheap as a leader who keeps organizing and marching and mobilizing youth to demand justice.

Sopheaps recognition on a global stage is testimony to the important efforts civil society organizations (CSOs, also called non-governmental organizations, or NGOs) are making to improve human rights in Cambodia.  Since joining the CCHR in 2005, she has worked on several campaigns for the release of imprisoned human rights activists, organized non-violent marches to preserve political space, campaigned for the protection of fundamental rights, and argued that defamation within the penal code should not be misused to unfairly punish free speech.  Earlier this year she accepted the role of executive director at CCHR.  Under her leadership, I am confident CCHR will continue to play a prominent role in promoting greater protections of human rights.  As a longstanding partner of the U.S. government, CCHR was just awarded $500,000 from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on a new project that will further promote and protect fundamental freedoms of speech and assembly.

I was really pleased that, in support of her efforts, Sopheap was recently selected to join a professional exchange program sponsored by the U.S. Department of State.  In September, she attended the International Visitor Leadership Program titled President Obamas Stand with Civil Society.  During her two weeks in the United States, Sopheap met with CSO leaders and representatives from local, state, and federal government, think tanks, academia, foundations, and businesses in order to share ideas and develop strategies to build a more robust civil society in Cambodia.  I believe that with new information and a newly acquired network of like-minded counterparts, Sopheap will become even more effective as a civil society leader.  In fact, upon her return to Cambodia, Sopheap wasted no time in building on the success of the program by partnering with another participant to write an opinion piece that appeared in the newspaper last week.

It has been inspiring to see that Sopheaps promotion of human rights does not end with her formal role at CCHR.  She is tech savvy, and not surprisingly, active on social media with a growing number of Twitter followers.  Since 2006, Sopheap has been blogging about opinions on society, politics, and good governance.  She also co-organized the third regional BlogFest Asia 2012 in Cambodia in an effort to bring greater international attention to the country.  I encourage you to check out her blog: http://sopheapfocus.com/.  As with so many great leaders, Sopheaps passion for progress is playing out in both her personal and professional life.  

I look forward to continuing our efforts to support the essential work of civil society in Cambodia.

How has civil society made a difference in your life?

Q: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COLLEGE AND A UNIVERSITY?

A: The terms, college and university, are used interchangeably and mean the same thing in the U.S. As a general rule, colleges tend to be smaller and usually offer only undergraduate degrees, while a university also offers graduate degrees. Within each college or university you will find schools, such as school of arts and sciences or the school of business.

Q: WHO CAN BECOME A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY STUDENT? ARE THERE AGE LIMITATIONS TO ATTEND U.S. COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES?

A: A high school education is usually required to become an undergraduate university student. Many institutions will not accept international students who are younger than age 17. There are sometimes exceptions to that general rule.",2011-12-23,12.0

Rather than making a new NGO law the top priority, which I believe is not needed, the National Assembly could consider addressing poverty, education, health care, and environmental protection.  However, improving the rule of law, which encompasses a broad range of topics that would ultimately benefit Cambodian citizens, is an area where both parties could work together...

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Watching the news yesterday, I was impressed to see stories about the many different ways people throughout Cambodia commemorated World AIDS Day 2014.  December 1 is a day to not only reflect on the many lives lost and forever changed as a result of AIDS, but also to celebrate the lives saved and recognize those working to eliminate this disease.  As I have stated before, the U.S. partnership with Cambodia to reduce HIV/AIDS infection rates here is one the most successful stories among our development assistance programs.  But with an estimated 75,000 people in Cambodia living with HIV and approximately 1,100 newly infected people each year, there is still much work to be done.  I commend the ongoing efforts of those taking on the challenge to create an AIDS-free generation in Cambodia, which includes government and civil society organizations.

The United States has focused its resources for eradicating HIV/AIDS in Cambodia and throughout the world through the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  With resources from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the PEPFAR office in Cambodia supports partnerships, programs and activities focused on saving lives.  Last year alone, PEPFAR assisted Cambodia in providing treatment to almost 50,000 people and HIV testing to over 80,000 pregnant women.  These and other PEPFAR-supported endeavors make the goal of an AIDS-free generation an achievable one.  To build on prior success, the total amount of U.S. government funding available through PEPFAR in 2015 for HIV/AIDS programs implemented by USAID and CDC in Cambodia will remain the same as in 2014.  The focus of this support is on delivering the highest impact interventions, bringing them to scale among the most vulnerable populations, and maintaining a sense of urgency to stop this epidemic.

I was recently reminded by a friend to reflect on what we have achieved together in Cambodia to fight HIV/AIDS.  Not so long ago, resources were so limited that hospital beds were filled with dying patients, while others lay dying on the floor.  Nearly 35 years into the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and more than 20 years since the first cases were detected here, Cambodia today is one of 12 countries in the world that provide universal access to HIV treatment, and the HIV prevalence rate in adults decreased by more than half from 1998 to 2010.  At the end of the day, the results of our joint efforts lives saved and new infections averted determine whether or not we are winning the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Without a doubt, Cambodias story is a true achievement.  Now the question is: how do we build off of our past achievements to obtain even greater success in the future?  

On World AIDS Day 2014 in Cambodia, organizations like Friends International and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation held programs that included youth activities and HIV testing.  The Labor Ministry awarded several companies in a range of sectors  including the garment industry, hospitality, banking, telecommunications, and entertainment  for providing HIV/AIDS education and counseling services to their employees.  These are just a few examples of the numerous individuals involved in the fight against this disease.  However, no one entity alone can create an AIDS-free generation in Cambodia.  That is why we must not only work towards our shared goal on December 1; it is a prolonged commitment.

The United States and the Royal Government of Cambodia have developed a strong partnership and have collaborated with other international, non-governmental, and civil society organizations to fight against HIV/AIDS.  With advances in science and technology, lifesaving knowledge and health care can be brought to even more people throughout Cambodia via collaboration.  Moving forward, I hope to see a continued emphasis on partnership to ensure that our collective investment is used efficiently and effectively, with maximal results. 

The vision for the next phase in the fight against HIV/AIDS is a defined, shared, and sustainable result.  I genuinely believe that if Cambodia maintains its commitment and continues to work with its partners, it has a very good chance of becoming the first country in the world with an AIDS-free generation.  Each of us can play a vital role in helping to create an AIDS-free generation in Cambodia.  On an individual level, we can make smart choices that will protect ourselves and our loved ones.  At the community level, we can embrace those who are struggling with HIV/AIDS and ensure that they have access to quality care and treatment.  And at the national and international level, we can continue working together through programs like PEPFAR to provide resources where they are needed most.  In recognition of World AIDS Day, I encourage each of you to do your part in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Cambodia.

What did you do in recognition of World AIDS Day 2014?  Please share your comments.

THANKSGIVING DAY, 2014
- - - - - - - 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

Thanksgiving Day invites us to reflect on the blessings we enjoy and the freedoms we cherish. As we gather with family and friends to take part in this uniquely American celebration, we give thanks for the extraordinary opportunities we have in a Nation of limitless possibilities, and we pay tribute to all those who defend our Union as members of our Armed Forces. This holiday reminds us to show compassion and concern for people we have never met and deep gratitude toward those who have sacrificed to help build the most prosperous Nation on earth. These traditions honor the rich history of our country and hold us together as one American family, no matter who we are or where we come from. 

Nearly 400 years ago, a group of Pilgrims left their homeland and sailed across an ocean in pursuit of liberty and prosperity. With the friendship and kindness of the Wampanoag people, they learned to harvest the rich bounty of a new world. Together, they shared a successful crop, celebrating bonds of community during a time of great hardship. Through times of war and of peace, the example of a Native tribe who extended a hand to a new people has endured. During the American Revolution and the Civil War, days of thanksgiving drew Americans together in prayer and in the spirit that guides us to better days, and in each year since, our Nation has paused to show our gratitude for our families, communities, and country. 

With God's grace, this holiday season we carry forward the legacy of our forebears. In the company of our loved ones, we give thanks for the people we care about and the joy we share, and we remember those who are less fortunate. At shelters and soup kitchens, Americans give meaning to the simple truth that binds us together: we are our brother's and our sister's keepers. We remember how a determined people set out for a better world -- how through faith and the charity of others, they forged a new life built on freedom and opportunity. 

The spirit of Thanksgiving is universal. It is found in small moments between strangers, reunions shared with friends and loved ones, and in quiet prayers for others. Within the heart of America's promise burns the inextinguishable belief that together we can advance our common prosperity -- that we can build a more hopeful, more just, and more unified Nation. This Thanksgiving, let us recall the values that unite our diverse country, and let us resolve to strengthen these lasting ties. 

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 27, 2014, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage the people of the United States to join together -- whether in our homes, places of worship, community centers, or any place of fellowship for friends and neighbors -- and give thanks for all we have received in the past year, express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own, and share our bounty with others. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-ninth.

As I promote the benefits of doing business in Cambodia to U.S. companies, I was glad to see Cambodian leaders also working actively to increase foreign investment in Cambodia.  At the investment conference of the International Business Chamber of Cambodia held in Phnom Penh this past week, Prime Minister Hun Sen said that in order to encourage greater investment, Cambodia must address the challenges of combating corruption, implementing legal, judicial, and financial reforms, and aligning education and vocational training with the demands of the job market.  The Prime Minister was absolutely right that progress in those areas will significantly boost investor confidence, as those concerns were often mentioned during my discussions with business leaders in the United States and in the ASEAN region.  Serious efforts to implement those reforms will attract more foreign investment, which in turn will lead to more business creation and better paying jobs in Cambodia.

Not only do I find special, wonderfully-made handicrafts at Tabitha, but I know that my purchases help to support local families and communities. 

I have long admired Tabitha Cambodias cottage industry program, which provides training, employment, and income for poor Cambodians to manufacture the silk handicrafts and other products Tabitha is famous for.  I also learned about the range of community development programs the organization uses to help the poorest people in Cambodia become self-sufficient and independent.  For example, one of Tabithas main programs focuses on personal and financial development.  The Family Partnerships and Savings Program helps families with no savings to set financial goals to make their lives better.  Through sustained support by Tabitha staff and interest earned on their savings, families obtain a sustainable source of income and are able to achieve their goals, including providing for their own food, clean water, and shelter.  Since its foundation, this program has made a positive impact on over half a million families in Cambodia!

Janne has tremendous energy and drive.  In addition to her responsibilities at Tabitha Cambodia, Janne has embarked on an ambitious endeavor to build the Nokor Tep Womens Hospital, which will treat impoverished women in need of gynecological medical care in Cambodia when completed.  Having lived in Cambodia for the past two decades, Janne realized how few quality medical services were available to women in the country.  Last weekend, the Nokor Tep group held their fourth annual walkathon, which brought together more than 750 participants and raised more than $75,000 for the hospital.

For over 20 years, Janne has worked tirelessly to empower the poorest families in Cambodia to lift themselves out of poverty.  Jannes story is truly inspiring, and is a testament to the power of one individual to create a positive impact and bring about long-lasting change.  I want to personally thank Janne for her long-term commitment to the Cambodian people.  Janne, you are truly an inspiration to us all!

-From the Ambassador's Penh

This week, I had the pleasure to welcome back my friend and colleague, Danny Russel, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs (you should follow his office on Twitter @USAsiaPacific).  This was not the Assistant Secretarys first visit to Cambodia.  Three years ago, he traveled to the Kingdom with President Barack Obama for meetings held here during Cambodias 2012 chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  As part of President Obamas rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, Russels visit highlights the United States commitment to strengthening our important bilateral relationship with Cambodia, as well as increasing cooperation with all of the countries of ASEAN.  

During his visit, Assistant Secretary Russel met with the government, political parties, civil society, youth, members of the press, and my Embassy team.  His first stop was a meeting with acting Foreign Minister Ouch Borith to continue our engagement with the Royal Government of Cambodia.  The two leaders discussed opportunities to boost bilateral ties and exchanged views on a number of regional issues.  The Assistant Secretary made clear that the United States supports progress in political reforms in order to strengthen Cambodian institutions.  They also talked about ways to create jobs and expand trade and investment for both countries.Next, the Assistant Secretary spoke to a diverse audience about the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region at a talk hosted by the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace (CICP).  I would like to thank the CICP for not only arranging the talk, but also for their work over the last 20 years to help inform the Cambodian government and people about important policy matters.

During a meeting with representatives of civil society, Assistant Secretary Russel learned how these organizations are involved in supporting reform efforts in Cambodia.  In previous blogs, I have highlighted some of the countrys top civil society leaders who are making significant contributions.  I firmly believe that civil society plays a vital role in addressing the challenges facing Cambodia.  Later that afternoon, Assistant Secretary Russel participated in a lively discussion with Cambodian members of President Obamas Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) who were invited to the Embassy.  He listened to their hopes and their aspirations for Cambodia and answered their questions about the issues that matter most them.  As he said, one of the ways we can support Cambodia youth is through the YSEALI program.  I couldnt agree more, and I hope more Cambodian youth join this active and growing community.  He later told me that the discussion with YSEALI members was his favorite event of the whole day.

Although he was only here for a short time, Assistant Secretary Russels visit demonstrates the commitment of the United States to partner with everyone  the government, political parties, civil society, and youth  to bring greater opportunity, prosperity, and democracy to the people of Cambodia.  I would like to personally thank all of the people who made this visit a success and who helped our Assistant Secretary to feel at home in Cambodia!

President Obama is the first U.S. President to visit Cuba in nearly 90 years.

This morning, a ceremony was held at the Council of Ministers to celebrate the homecoming of a 10th century statue of the Torso of Rama from Prasat Chen, Koh Ker, which had been in the collection of the Denver Art Museum for 30 years.  The Torso of Rama was returned by the Denver Art Museum after experts confirmed that the object had in fact been looted from its original home.

In his remarks, Denver Art Museum director Dr. Christoph Heinrich called the Torso of Rama an Ambassador of Cambodias distinguished tradition and culture that brought delight and wonder to millions of our visitors of our museum.

We are happy today to see this honorable Ambassador returning back home to be united with other important pieces from the temple of Koh Ker, said Dr. Heinrich.  The Torso of Rama is the seventh object from Koh Ker to be returned from U.S. collections.

The homecoming event was led by H.E. Yim Nolson, Vice-Chairman of the Economic, Social and Cultural Council of Cambodia, and was attended by Ambassador Heidt, UNESCO Representative in Cambodia Anne Lemaistre, and many distinguished guests from the diplomatic and cultural community.  The activities included a blessing dance and a garland ceremony.  To see more photos from this event, go to https://www.flickr.com/photos/usembassyphnompenh/",2016-03-28,54.0

We are honored that he generously shared his wisdom and expertise with us on issues ranging from health to worker rights to education and democracy. If there was a single theme that united his work, it was a belief in Cambodias future and its people. Though Dr. Leys voice was silenced, we are confident his spirit was not. The United States stands by the people of Cambodia in this time of sorrow.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

As a reader of my blog, you know that I am deeply committed to assisting the people of Cambodia in improving their lives and their country.  Sharing this commitment are the members of my team at the U.S. Embassy  which includes Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung  and remarkable organizations like the ones that I like to write about in my blog.  Recently, Julie visited the Center for Khmer Studies (CKS), a premier international research center in Cambodia.  Based in Siem Reap, CKS supports and participates in a wide variety of research programs.  Dr. Krisna Uk, Executive Director of CKS, gave an overview of the centers work to support research, teaching, and public service in the social sciences, arts, and humanities in Cambodia.  Krisna is a distinguished international scholar, having studied and received degrees from universities in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.  She has worked extensively in Cambodia, from documenting the lives of the Jarai ethnic minority for her PhD to researching the impact of landmines and unexploded ordnances in communities living in high risk areas.

Founded in 1999, CKS receives support from the U.S. Department of States Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to fund a variety of projects, including fellowship programs, conferences and lecture series, and new academic programs in collaboration with U.S. academic institutions.  As the only member of the Council of American Overseas Research Centers located in mainland Southeast Asia, CKS provides scholars and visitors around the world with excellent training and research opportunities, first-class academic publications, and unique research facilities.  I also learned that CKS operates one of Cambodias few public libraries  which is also the largest one outside of Phnom Penh.

For many years, CKS has offered institutional support, fellowships, and language training to U.S. students and scholars.  This has enabled American scholars to develop a greater understanding of the economic and cultural forces shaping Cambodia.  The center also helps foster cultural exchanges and academic collaborations between American scholars and their Cambodian counterparts in order to build human resources, transfer knowledge and expertise, and develop strong partnerships.  Thus, I am pleased that U.S. Fulbright scholar Cheryl Yin is a Senior Fellow at CKS, researching how the Khmer language has changed since 1979 for her dissertation and PhD. 

CKS has established partnerships with a number of U.S. institutions of higher learning to educate American students about the history and culture of Cambodia.  The University of Wisconsin-Madison sends undergraduate students for a three-week study abroad course entitled Buddhism and Service Learning in Cambodia.  During this course, students work with local NGOs and schools to closely examine the intersections of religion, ethics, social problems, and social work in the majority Theravada Buddhist community in Siem Reap.  In the Chinese Empire and the Cambodian Experience course, students from Cornell University and from community colleges in the surrounding New York area come to CKS to learn more about Cambodias history and relations with other countries in the region.  Later this year, CKS will expand this model of success by bringing students from the University of California-Berkeley and community colleges in Californias Bay Area to Cambodia for a quality educational experience.

I appreciate the efforts of Krisna and CKS to support academic research and provide an environment for scholars, students, and artists to collaborate.  I am proud the U.S. government can support CKS to strengthen Cambodias cultural and academic institutions and integrate Cambodian scholars into the international community.  This is just one example of how Americans and Cambodians work together to increase mutual understanding and deepen the connections between our two countries.

It means connecting them with input suppliers and markets both here and abroad.

Ambassador Heidt joined Deputy Prime Minister H.E. Dr. Yim Chhay Ly at the Intercontinental Hotel this morning to commemorate five years of the U.S. government's Feed the Future programs in Cambodia. Farmers, policy makers, donors, government officials, private companies, and members of civil society will be in Phnom Penh from June 2-3 to review the significant achievements in #agriculture, #nutrition, and poverty reduction that have taken place through the Feed the Future initiative, implemented by USAID Cambodia in cooperation with the Royal Government of Cambodia.

Lack of food is not the only cause of malnutrition and hunger.  Two other major factors are infectious disease and sanitation, which affect the bodys ability to ingest and utilize food.  A brand-new USAID program called Nourish is going to be launched in the next couple of weeks and will support Cambodias efforts to improve the nutrition of women and children through improved sanitation and hygiene.  Improving the nutritional status of women and raising awareness about nutrition and sanitation among mothers will go a long way towards creating a better future for Cambodias children. 

I am proud of the work that the U.S. Embassy is doing in conjunction with the Cambodian government, the NGO community, and other international partners to improve food security and nutrition in Cambodia.  This is clearly an issue where Cambodians of all political parties should work together for the benefit of Cambodias most vulnerable groups.  The United States will continue to look for ways to bring groups together to advance our common goal of ending malnutrition and hunger in Cambodia and to help the next generation of Cambodians to achieve their full potential.

#USAID is currently supporting Cambodian Disabled People's Organization (CDPO) on a project to increase voting access for the disabled in the electoral reform process. A workshop yesterday brought together CDPO partners representing different types of disabilities to provide recommendations on voting access to be integrated into draft laws. Priorities are for voter registration to be accessible to all voters with disability, voter information to cater voters with disabilities and recruitment policies to encourage persons with disabilities. As part of the advocacy efforts, a radio program is being prepared to inform listeners on the progress.

The aid seeks to promote Cambodias economic and social progress by improving and expanding public education, building infrastructure, and modernizing the armed forces among other activities.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Since arriving in Cambodia three years ago, Ive been captivated by the live music scene in Phnom Penh. The wide-ranging music, from traditional Khmer songs to more contemporary genres, that is being played at venues around the city is truly outstanding. I was sorry to learn that a number of music venues in Phnom Penh have closed in recent months due in part to increasing costs. Though this will no doubt impact some local musicians in the short term, I am hopeful that Cambodias music scene will continue to flourish and rise to even greater heights in the future.

In many ways, the music scene in Phnom Penh today is the legacy from a previous generation of Cambodian musicians who produced their own unique sound during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. That era is considered by many the golden age of Cambodian rock-and-roll. As you may recall, Phnom Penh hosted the world premiere of the documentary Dont Think Ive Forgotten: Cambodias Lost Rock and Roll last year. The film, directed by American John Pirozzi, featured video footage of the many gifted Cambodian musicians who created a vibrant music scene that symbolized the exuberance and promise of that period.

Dont Think Ive Forgotten is currently on tour in the United States, where it is getting rave reviews. Some of the screenings are accompanied by live concerts by some of the surviving musicians of the era, including the three remaining members of Baksey Cham Krong  Cambodias first surf guitar band  as well as Sinn Sethakol, grandson of legendary singer Sinn Sisamouth. Im delighted that the Embassy was able to support the travel of some of these musicians so that their music can be heard by a brand new and appreciative audience.

After the screening and concert at the American Film Institute (AFI) Silver Theater near Washington, DC last week, Sinn Sethakol told Voice of America that he learned new things about his famous grandfather after watching the film. Id seen his face on CD covers and heard his voice, Sethakol said. After I watched the movie, I became very emotional. All Cambodian families were broken apart because of Pol Pots regime, he continued. Audience member Duong Ti told VOA that the film and concert had given him a new understanding of Cambodian music and history. Seeing the performers live not only made me very proud, but also like a whole person. I am proud of them, proud of my heritage, proud to be part of the community, Duong said.
It is very encouraging to see that the film is reaching a wider audience. I have no doubt that anyone who watches the film will come away with a better understanding of the talented and dynamic musicians who emerged in Cambodia and captivated audiences in the decades before the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge period. I believe these artists musicians from Cambodias golden age will continue to inspire Cambodian musicians and influence todays music scene.

Speaking of todays music scene, earlier this week Phnom Penh welcomed American pop star Demi Lovato, who added Cambodia to her world tour after an outpouring of support from her fans on Facebook. Students from the U.S. Embassys Opportunity Fund program at the American Corner at Pannasastra University were at the concert and reported that they had a fantastic time. Cambodia has not hosted many top musical acts in recent years, but I hope that the success of Demi Lovatos concert will encourage many more to come.

Before Demi took the stage, Cambodian-American pop singer Laura Mam opened the concert with an electrifying performance that included her latest song Yosop Yulsong, which calls on young Cambodians to search for the hero within themselves and follow their dreams. Laura is from San Jose, California but now lives here in Cambodia and can be seen performing at events throughout the country. I have been following her career with great interest and expect many great things to come.
I would love to hear what you have to say about Phnom Penhs music scene and where you like to go to listen to live music. Please share your thoughts in the comments section.

2003: The United States and Cambodia sign an agreement to restrict the import of Cambodian artifacts into the U.S.  market, in an attempt to prevent looting of Cambodias cultural heritage. A highlight of the deal is the repatriation in 2007 of a sandstone Apsara dancer from the 13th Century that had been smuggled into the United States. U.S. assistance also helps restore some of Cambodias most precious Angkorean monuments, including an ambitious $1.5 million project to preserve Phnom Bakheng temple.

2006: Former President Bill Clinton visits Cambodia in December. During a meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen, he signs a memorandum of understanding under which his Clinton Foundation will provide support in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, bilateral U.S. assistance makes a major impact on HIV/AIDS over the course of the decade, helping to cut the diseases prevalence rate from 2% to less than 1%, making Cambodia a rare success story in the global fight against the disease.

2006: The United States opens a new Embassy in January. The facility, which is located next to the famed Wat Phnom temple on Phnom Penhs north side, occupies an entire city block and houses over 500 employees. As the first purpose-built U.S. Embassy in Cambodia, the new complex is a sign of growing U.S. engagement in the country.

2007: On April 4, the Peace Corps swears in its first class of volunteers to serve in Cambodia. The 29 volunteers serve their two-year tours living with Cambodian families in rural villages throughout the country, teaching English at upper secondary schools and regional teacher training centers. Successive classes swell in size as the decade continues.

2009: The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, better known as the Khmer Rouge tribunal, begins its first case on February 16. The defendant is Kaing Guek Eav, better known by his revolutionary name Duch, who oversaw the torture and execution of some 12,000 people as warden of Tuol Sleng prison. After 30 years of waiting, Cambodian witnesses finally appear in a court of law to describe the horrors they endured under the Democratic Kampuchea regime. A verdict in Duchs case is expected in the summer of 2010. Meanwhile, the four remaining Khmer Rouge leaders in custody are likely to face trial in 2011.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Next month, Cambodian students across the country will take their final high school examinations.  Final exams are an opportunity for students to demonstrate their knowledge and practice good study habits.  But exam season can also be a stressful time for students, especially when it is difficult to find a quiet place to study.  As students prepare for their exams, I hope that they take advantage of the academic resources that the U.S. Embassy offers to the Cambodian public. 

One example of these resources is within our very own Embassy grounds.  The Information Resource Center (IRC) is U.S. Embassy Phnom Penhs library, where students have a space to study, surrounded by books, magazines, and computers  all accessible to the public for free.  Open Monday to Friday from 8:30-11:30 a.m. and 1:30-4:30 p.m., the IRC also has an impressive online collection of books and materials available for all visitors.  

The IRC is also a space for students to practice their communication skills during our bi-monthly English language chats.  High school students, English language Fellows from the United States, and other volunteers come together to discuss a variety of topics ranging from environmental sustainability and American culture to the education in Cambodia.  I am happy to learn that many students take advantage of this opportunity to meet other young leaders, practice their English, and, most importantly, express their opinions and goals for the future.  

Along with the IRC, the U.S. Embassy is also proud to host four American Corners in Cambodia, located in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Battambang, and Kampong Cham.  An American Corner is a friendly and accessible space open to the public that provides current and reliable information about the United States through a large collection of books, magazines, films and documentaries.  Like the IRC, the American Corners also have free Internet and resource materials such as practice books for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the Student Aptitude Test (SAT), and the American College Testing (ACT) exam  examples of standardized tests that a student might take if applying to study in the United States.  The presence of American Corners throughout Cambodia is indicative of the United States commitment to providing access to education and information for all students.  I strongly encourage all students to take advantage of the spaces available to them to study for their examinations.  

The American Corner in Phnom Penh and the Royal University of Phnom Penh are also locations with EducationUSA Advising Centers.  EducationUSA provides a wealth of information on U.S. educational institutions and how to enroll in these schools.  When I meet with young Cambodian students, they often tell me that it is their dream to study in the United States.  EducationUSA can assist students in making this dream come true.  Experienced and helpful consultants are ready to meet with students for one-on-one advising and even identify possible scholarships and other financial aid sources.  

But the American Corners are more than just a place to study.  They are a place for people of all ages to learn about the culture and history of the United States, to take ownership of their education, and to have fun learning new information.  American Corner locations host speakers and events on a variety of topics.  Through diverse and consistent programming, American Corners help provide Cambodians with exciting cultural exchange opportunities.  I hope that through these experiences, people will help amplify their worldview, learn to think critically, and share their ideas and opinions in a space they can consider safe and welcoming. 

We offer these spaces and resources with students in mind, because we know that their success today will be Cambodias prosperity tomorrow.   To all students entering exams, I wish you the best of luck in your studies.  I also hope you will continue to use our American Corner locations and programming beyond the exam seasons.  Your participation will make all the difference in incentivizing more young people to become catalysts for their education and success. 

Have you visited or attended an event at one of our American Corners or the Information Resource Center at the U.S. Embassy?  Please comment and tell me about your experience.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Ive written before on this blog about the value of internships as a way for young Cambodians to explore a possible career, gain valuable job experience, and enhance their resume.  Internships are also popular in the United States, and an increasing number of young Americans are looking for opportunities overseas in places like Cambodia.  This summer, the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh is proud to host a number of students and recent graduates from the United States.  Working alongside our diplomats and local staff, our interns will contribute in meaningful ways to the U.S.-Cambodia relationship while getting to know and appreciate this wonderful country.

Three of our interns are here on prestigious fellowships from the U.S. government.  Jessica Pham and Sandra Zuniga Guzman received the Thomas R. Pickering Fellowship from the U.S. State Department, while Emma Din is a recipient of the Donald M. Payne Fellowship through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  The Pickering and Payne Fellowships are among a group of highly competitive programs that are specifically designed to increase the diversity and talent of our diplomatic corps.  Upon completion of their internships, Jessica, Sandra, and Emma will be joining the U.S. Foreign Service to begin their careers as diplomats.

The opportunity to participate in a series of internships in the United States and overseas is at the heart of these fellowship programs.  Our Embassy interns will have a chance to see how diplomacy works and to develop skills that will help them be successful in their careers.  For proof that these programs work, you dont have to look any further than here at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, where there are two Pickering Fellows alumni currently serving in key roles.  Deputy Chief of Mission Julie Chung was part of the first class of Pickering Fellows and had an overseas internship at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn, Germany (before the capital moved to Berlin).  Assistant Public Affairs Officer C.J. Woods was named a Pickering Fellow in 2009.  C.J. did his overseas internship at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand where, believe it or not, he worked with Julie.  It truly is a small world!

I am also proud of our former interns at the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia who have moved on to even bigger and better things.  Last summer, Pickering Fellow Donna Hernandez was an intern in our Public Affairs Section.  During her internship, Donna worked on speeches, organized cultural events, and visited our American Corners to speak with young Cambodians.  Today, Donna is in Washington, DC as a newly-minted U.S. Foreign Service officer preparing for her first assignment.  Donna says that her time as an intern in Cambodia has prepared her for a career as a diplomat and that she hopes to come back to Southeast Asia to build on her experience here. 

In addition to programs for U.S. interns, the Embassy also provides internships for Cambodian university students.  This July, we will be giving 12 promising young Cambodians an opportunity to gain experience in areas such as financial management, information technology, and human resources.  These students will have the chance to develop their leadership skills and prepare themselves for future career opportunities.  If you are interested in learning more about U.S. Embassy internship program opportunities for Cambodians, please be sure to check our website and to follow us on Facebook.

Internships are not the only way to gain experience, but done properly they can become an invaluable part of a young persons academic and professional development.  I encourage young Cambodians to follow the example of Jessica, Sandra, and Emma, who are using internships to further their careers and to make a difference in the world.  We are lucky to have them, and I wish them and their fellow interns the very best for a fun and productive summer.

Many of these conversations occurred on May 17, recognized globally as the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia (#IDAHOT). Here in Cambodia, IDAHOT was part of the 12th annual celebration of Pride Week, organized each year to raise awareness about the rights of the LGBTI community. Cambodia is not a country that criminalizes LGBTI behavior. In fact, His Majesty the late King Father Norodom Sihanouk expressed his support for same-sex marriage in Cambodia as early as 2004. I commend the Prime Minister for urging Cambodians not to discriminate against LGBTI persons. Through legal reform, open dialogue, and sustained partnerships, we can expect to bring an end to violence and discrimination against LGBTI people in Cambodia. Along with the Cambodian government, NGOs and civil society play a valuable role by partnering with us to improve conditions and promote the advancement of LGBTI rights."" - #AmbTodd #Cambodia

The Ambassador also notes the leadership of the Royal Government of Cambodia, in particular the Ministry of Womens Affairs, in conducting this survey.  But first, the Ambassador outlines some of the effects of violence on children:

Before we look at the study, we have to understand the impact and consequences of violence against children.  Scientific research has shown that when a child is harmed through an act of violence, there are demonstrable physical and emotional consequences for the child.  Child victims suffer long-term adverse effects in their cognitive development and their mental health.  For example, they are more likely to suffer from mental distress, to contract sexually transmitted diseases, to inflict self-harm, and more likely to become alcoholics.  All of these impacts are detrimental for the victims who suffer them, while the cost to society of addressing these consequences is enormous.  For Cambodia alone, the estimated economic loss attributable to these impacts was $161 million in 2013, according to UNICEF.  Furthermore, children who experience violence are more likely to become victims and perpetrators of violence as adults, thereby perpetuating a tragic cycle of violence.

I understand that people may be concerned about the Ebola virus spreading to Cambodia.  According to the CDC, the risk is very low since Ebola is not airborne and people only spread the infection after they have symptoms.  Nevertheless, our health team at the U.S. Embassy, including experts with US CDC, has been working with the Royal Government of Cambodia and with the WHO to ensure that the appropriate measures have been put in place so that infection will not spread in the unlikely event that someone with Ebola comes to Cambodia.

From Destroyer Squadron 7 Public Affairs

SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia - The fifth convening of the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Cambodia exercise began at Ream Naval Base, October 27.

Vice Adm. Robert Thomas, commander, U.S. 7th Fleet, delivered opening ceremony remarks before participating U.S. Navy Sailors and members of the Royal Cambodian Navy.

""We've made steady progress in just a few years, growing CARAT from a basic port visit to a series of training events on Ream Naval Base and culminating this year in a two-day sea phase in the Gulf of Thailand.""

CARAT provides a credible venue for regional navies to share best practices and foster maritime security cooperation. The RCN joined the CARAT series in 2010, making it the first dedicated exercise between both navies in several decades. 

Ashore, personnel will conduct hands-on training in damage control, navigation, tactical combat casualty care (TCCC), force protection and visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) techniques. For the first time, the Royal Cambodian Air Force will participate in a joint search and rescue exchange. Symposia will bring together professionals from both navies to discuss best practices in military law, military medicine and aviation search and rescue.

At sea, USS Mustin (DDG 89), embarked with Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 7 staff and an MH-60R helicopter, will train with two RCN Stenka-class patrol boats. In addition to maneuvering and surface gunnery drills, highlights include a shiprider exchange, maritime boarding scenarios and a search and rescue exercise. 

Also as part of CARAT 2014, USNS Safeguard (T-ARS 50) and embarked mobile diving and salvage unit (MDSU) conducted a bilateral diving exercise focused on diving medicine, port security and underwater hull inspection from Oct. 21-25.

""Maritime security challenges in this region are real,"" continued Thomas. ""No one nation can address these challenges alone which is why exercises like CARAT are critical to promoting regional stability.""

Capt. Fred Kacher, Destroyer Squadron 7 commodore, remarked that he looked forward to this year's underway phase with the RCN.

""Successfully operating at-sea together is crucial as both our nations work hard to keep sea lanes safe throughout Southeast Asia,"" said Kacher. ""I am impressed with the increased complexity that this year's CARAT exercise brings and am excited for the opportunity to operate underway with our Cambodian counterparts.""

In its 20th year, CARAT is a series of bilateral naval exercises between the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and the armed forces of nine partner nations in South and Southeast Asia.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

In todays globalized economy and with the economic integration of ASEAN countries in 2015, mastery of the English language is a critical tool for Cambodias future leaders.  Many jobs now require at least some ability in English, so young people are becoming more interested in learning the language.  Some communities, however, still lack adequate resources for those seeking to improve their English language skills.  To assist, the U.S. Embassy helps young Cambodians and their families through the English Access Microscholarship Program (Access).  When I hear about the Access Program, I am most inspired by stories about the impact that it continues to have on youth throughout the country.

A native of Phnom Penh, Afiny Math left school at an early age to work and help her family financially.  Due to limited financial resources, it was nearly impossible for her to have an opportunity to receive a good education.  Seeking to improve her English language skills, Afiny applied to the Access Program and was selected.  Upon graduation from the program, she received employment with the Cambodian Islamic Youth Association  the same organization that administered the Access Program where she was a participant.  Today, Afiny is a role model and a good example of how English language learning can have an impact on ones life. 

Afinys story is featured on the website for the U.S. State Department's English Access Microscholarship Program.  She is one of approximately 95,000 students from more than 85 countries that have participated in the program since 2004.  Through after-school classes and intensive summer learning activities, talented youth aged 13-20 receive a strong foundation of English language skills.  Additionally, they develop an appreciation for American culture and values, enhance their ability to compete for and participate in future U.S. government exchange and study programs, and increase their capability to successfully participate in their countrys development.

Over the past 10 years, the Access Program has provided scholarships to more than 1,000 Cambodian students in 11 provinces.  Working with a number of NGOs to administer the program, Access has provided students with friendly learning environments to practice their English language and critical thinking skills.   To enhance their English learning experience, U.S. Embassy staff visit Access Program sites across the country to present certificates, give presentations, or simply have conversations with the students.  Each year, I have the pleasure of meeting several Access Program students and teachers during the English Camp hosted at the U.S. Embassy.  We invest as much as we can to ensure that each participant in the Access Program has an enjoyable experience that will contribute to their continued study of the English language.  

I feel strongly about Cambodians having access to quality English education.  Along with the Access Program, the U.S. Embassy supports English language education in Cambodia in a variety of ways.  English Language Fellows from the United States are working with the National Institute of Education and regional teacher training centers to strengthen curriculum development and professional skills for both teacher trainers and teacher trainees.  Cambodian English language teachers receive instruction training and materials to better prepare their students.  Peace Corps Volunteers are assisting teachers and providing English instruction in 14 provinces.  These and other programs help to increase Cambodias competitiveness by giving people the ability to pursue higher quality education and better jobs.  Furthermore, Cambodians will have the opportunity to utilize the knowledge and skills that they have acquired to assist in developing their communities.  A group of Access students in Ratanakiri are already proving this by helping to establish a library in their local community.  After seeing the commitment demonstrated by the participants of our English language programs, I am confident in their ability to contribute to Cambodias progress.

Through the English Access Microscholarship and other programs, the United States remains committed to helping the people of Cambodia to achieve success and prosperity.  Whenever I speak to young Cambodians, I am pleased to hear so much excitement and interest about English language learning and studying in the United States.  In addition to giving them the skills they need to thrive, these present-day opportunities will help lead Cambodia into a more prosperous future.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Recently, I read in the newspaper that Cambodia has made tremendous gains in the reduction of infant and children under five mortality rates. For every 1,000 children born in Cambodia, 28 die before reaching the age of one, which is down from 95 in 2000. The mortality rate of children under five is 35 per 1,000, down from 124 in 2000. Another sign of progress is the decrease in the maternal mortality rate  206 per 100,000 live births in 2010, down from 472 in 2005. This is welcome news, and I applaud the government and the Ministry of Health for its commitment to address this issue by improving Cambodias health infrastructure. Nevertheless, we can all do more to reduce the preventable deaths of Cambodian mothers and children.

Thats why I want to recognize the efforts of the many local and international organizations that are fighting to save the lives of Cambodian mothers and children. One such organization is the Reproductive and Child Health Alliance (RACHA)  under the leadership of Executive Director Chan Theary  which works in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Ministry of Health, and other donors to improve the quality of maternal and newborn care, further strengthening the capacity and services at local health facilities across the country. For her efforts, the U.S. Embassy recognized Chan Theary as a Woman of Courage in 2012 for demonstrating exceptional leadership in advocating for womens rights and empowerment. To this day, Theary continues to help Cambodian girls and mothers live as healthy, dynamic participants in their communities, contributing to a more prosperous Cambodian society.

A key component of RACHAs efforts to reduce maternal mortality is the Life Saving Skills program that improves the professional skills and knowledge of midwives. RACHA provides critical training which enable midwives to identify and respond effectively to life-threatening emergencies. As the primary health care staff at local health centers in rural areas, midwives are essential to ensuring the health of mothers and their babies. If we continue working together to expand universal access to a well-educated, well-equipped, and regulated midwifery workforce, we can further reduce the number of maternal deaths in Cambodia.

Last month, health authorities said malnutrition costs the Cambodian economy $400 million a year, with maternal and child malnutrition totaling nearly $90 million a year. Malnutrition is a complicated issue that requires the private sector and government to work closely together, to deliver services such as clean water and access to proper nutrition. For its part, RACHA has implemented a number of programs that aim to improve nutrition for mothers and children. For example, RACHA trains volunteers who teach mothers and other community members about preparation of nutritional meals, food security, hygiene, home gardening, and poultry and fish farming. Another program promotes breastfeeding and growth monitoring of children under two years old. To reduce the prevalence of anemia and vitamin A deficiencies in mothers and children, RACHA has encouraged the producers of fish sauce, soy sauce, and vegetable oil to add iron and Vitamin A to their products. And to address the lack of safe drinking water, RACHA established several community-based water filtration systems that serve poor families, schools, commune offices, and village health support groups.

While tremendous gains have been made over the years, additional work is necessary to further reduce maternal and infant mortality and to improve child and maternal nutrition. Thats why the Royal Government of Cambodia, USAID, the UN Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) worked together to shine a stronger light on malnutrition in Cambodia at last months Nutrition Conference. The Conference highlighted the challenges that Cambodia faces to overcome chronic malnutrition suffered by many of its mothers and children. The meeting also helped the country recognize important steps that need to be taken to overcome nutrition and health problems. It is this kind of collaboration that will ensure the health and well being of Cambodian mothers and children continue to improve.

Did you know that the United States purchased over $3 billion in Cambodian goods in 2015? The majority of these products come from textile manufacturers located across #Cambodia. Recently, Ambassador Heidt visited two garment factories: Pactics in Siem Reap and Cambodian Textiles Worldwide (CTW) in Phnom Penh. 

Pactics employs 350 people and produces 50 million products annually, mostly microfiber cloths and pouches for designer brand sunglasses. In addition to investments made in sustainable building measures and energy saving technology, the company also offers its employees fair wages, reasonable working hours, safe and clean working conditions, and a full array of other benefits aimed to keep workers healthy.

CTW produces aprons, table linen, bed sheets, hospital apparel, and other specialty textiles. The American-owned company works diligently to maintain a work environment that is both productive and worker friendly. CTW also employs Cambodians in positions of management and actively promotes its employees.  

These two factories are vital to the success of Cambodia's garment industry, which generates over 80% of national export income. But as the managers of the companies told #AmbHeidt, their success is due to the investments made in their employees. For sustained labor productivity and economic growth in Cambodia, the health and reliability of the garment industry workforce is essential.",2016-02-23,21.0

This can absolutely be said about the U.S. Navy Seabees, who have had a 25 person team present in Cambodia since 2008.  The team has been busy constructing water wells, maternity ward clinics, and modern bathroom facilities to improve conditions for the people of Cambodias provinces.  The Seabees also provide basic life support (BLS) training that includes lessons on proper sanitation and hygiene, snake bites, and basic stitching methods.  The Seabees support the U.S. Embassy and USAID by constructing 2-room maternity wards and 5-stall bathroom facilities in an effort to improve pre and post natal care for mothers and to improve the health and sanitation conditions for students.  
   
The Seabees completed maternity wards are already serving a combined population of 55,278 Cambodians and supporting an average of 390 births per year.  The bathroom facilities are currently serving a student population of 3,506.  Over the next three years the Seabees will construct maternity wards and modern bathrooms throughout six provinces that will serve over 90 villages and 77,000 people.

The #MTPTrain took Pichleap through the state of Texas this week, visiting the cities of Austin and San Antonio to experience American culture, learn from special guest speakers, and exchange ideas with other young leaders. Here's what she had to say about her time:

""San Antonio is definitely one of my favorite cities. San Antonio to me seems like a great place for those who want to leave their marks as the city is growing and developing. Because the day we arrived in San Antonio was Memorial Day, I had a difficult time contacting local women in technology for the interview. But it turned out to be pretty good. I got to interview a woman in tech. As other amazing women in tech I talked to, Leslie left me feel so inspired. She gave good advice to young girls and women out there. After the interview, I had a great time walking around San Antonio with other two Fulbrighters from Poland and South Africa. We took a boat ride along the river walk. The ticket costs $8.50, but it's worth every single penny. It's so relaxing and refreshing.""

As we confront our own vulnerabilities, the U.S. government also recognizes the challenges that Cambodians face in preparing for, and responding to, natural disasters.

Step 4: Apply for your student visa

Be prepared for the student visa process!  Become familiar with the student visa requirements and allow plenty of time to prepare your application.

You will first need to receive an admission letter a certificate of eligibility for nonimmigrant student status from your U.S. University before you can begin the visa application.

Because interviews are short, do your best to explain why you want to study in the United States, how you plan to support yourself while in school, and what your plans are for when your studies are finished.

Did you know the U.S. Department of State issued 781,719 student and exchange visitor visas in fiscal year 2011? This translates to a worldwide acceptance rate of almost 86%. 

Many accredited U.S. colleges and universities now offer entire distance education programs of study entirely online. If you are accepted to one of these programs, you will not have to apply for a visa, since you physically will not be taking classes in the United States. However, if your online degree program requires you to take a seminar in the U.S. for academic credit, then you'll need a student visa. Again, a consular officer will determine the visa category you will need based on the purpose of your travel, and your supporting documentation.

I also want to speak to you about an issue of great significance to me as a First Lady, and more importantly, as the mother of two young daughters.

Like millions of people across the globe, my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than 200 Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night. 

This unconscionable act was committed by a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education  grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls. 

And I want you to know that Barack has directed our government to do everything possible to support the Nigerian governments efforts to find these girls and bring them home. 

In these girls, Barack and I see our own daughters.

We see their hopes, their dreams  and we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now.

Many of them may have been hesitant to send their daughters off to school, fearing that harm might come their way. 

But they took that risk because they believed in their daughters promise and wanted to give them every opportunity to succeed. 

The girls themselves also knew full well the dangers they might encounter. 

Their school had recently been closed due to terrorist threats but these girls still insisted on returning to take their exams. 

They were so determined to move to the next level of their educationso determined to one day build careers of their own and make their families and communities proud.   

And what happened in Nigeria was not an isolated incident. It is a story we see every day as girls around the world risk their lives to pursue their ambitions. 

Its the story of girls like Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan.

Malala spoke out for girls education in her community, and as a result, she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while on a school bus with her classmates. 

But fortunately Malala survivedand when I met her last year, I could feel her passion and determination as she told me that girls education is still her lifes mission. 

As Malala said in her address to the United Nations, she said The terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions but nothing changed in my life except this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born.

The courage and hope embodied by Malala and girls like her around the world should serve as a call to action. 

Because right now, more than 65 million girls worldwide are not in school. 

Yet, we know that girls who are educated make higher wages, lead healthier lives, and have healthier families. 

And when more girls attend secondary school, that boosts their countrys entire economy. 

So education is truly a girls best chance for a bright future, not just for herself, but for her family and her nation. 

And thats true right here in the U.S. as wellso I hope the story of these Nigerian girls will serve as an inspiration for every girl  and boy  in this country. 

I hope that any young people in America who take school for granted  any young people who are slacking off or thinking of dropping out  I hope they will learn the story of these girls and recommit themselves to their education.

These girls embody the best hope for the future of our worldand we are committed to standing up for them not just in times of tragedy or crisis, but for the long haul.

We are committed to giving them the opportunities they deserve to fulfill every last bit of their God-given potential. 

So today, let us all pray for their safe return... let us hold their families in our hearts during this very difficult timeand let us show just a fraction of their courage in fighting to give every girl on this planet the education that is her birthright.  Thank you.

While not an official holiday, the traditional October 31 Halloween celebration is very popular with children in the United States.  On Halloween, children dress up in costumes  often depicting ghosts, goblins, and other supernatural creatures  and collect candy and other treats from adults.  This is called trick-or-treating.  Plenty of adults also celebrate Halloween by attending costume parties, although they might prefer to dress up to look like celebrities, political candidates, or other public figures.

Most Americans consider Halloween a festive occasion, but its roots long predate the United States and its meaning has changed greatly over time. Even today, many other nations observe their own versions of this festival.

Halloween is also a time for frightening stories.  Stories like The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, written by Washington Irving in 1820, are told to children to add an atmosphere of fun and wonder to Halloween. VOA has a version of the story on its website.  Visit that page here:  http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/sleepy-hollow-washington-irving-legend-american-stories/2455431.html

Are you a professional interested in learning more ways to help your local economy?  The YSEALI Professional Fellows Program offers an exciting opportunity to join other professionals in broadening your expertise.
  
Emerging business leaders from around the world meet in the United States to complete fellowships in relevant businesses, government offices, non-profit organizations, or business associations.  The program also connects professional fellows with Americans in the same field, to develop enduring professional ties.  

YSEALI Professional Fellows is now accepting applications until December 1st, 2014.          

Chhair Sokty participated in the program this year, and shared this detailed account: 

I participated in Economic Empowerment Fellowship Program for five weeks from Oct 4 to Nov 9.  There were 14 fellows from five countries in Lower Mekong such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.  We spent four weeks in Montana for lecture on U.S. social, economic, and political system, fellowship with an organization, and study tour on nature and livelihood of people; and one week in DC to visit federal offices and other organizations.  We had opportunity to meet other professional fellows from Southeast Asia and all five continents with the total number of over 250.  We have learned and shared personal, professional, and cultural experience with fellow friends and developed lasting friendship without border.  Our gratitude goes to the Department of State and Mansfield Center of Montana University which have sponsored and coordinated our activities to the maximum benefit. I also had opportunity to introduce Preah Vihear Temple to students and professors at Mansfield Center.

As half the planet, women make immeasurable contributions to our world. They are entrepreneurs, farmers, educators, scientists, artists, soldiers, mothers, heads of state  the list is endless. Without them, economies would collapse, political systems would deteriorate, and families and communities would fall apart. Yet in too many places, women are treated as second-class citizens. Their abilities are undervalued. And their human rights  the right to learn, to express themselves, to live free from violence, to choose whether and whom to marry  are routinely violated.

This gap between womens inherent value and how many of them are treated every day is one of the great injustices of our time. On this International Women's Day, we recommit ourselves to closing that gap.

That means supporting girls' education. Right now, 62 million girls worldwide who should be in school aren't. Millions more are at risk of losing their access to education. This week, Michelle and I announced an initiative called ""Let Girls Learn,"" to help dismantle the barriers  economic, political and cultural  that stand in the way of girls who want to learn.

I'm convinced that a world in which women and girls are treated as equal to men and boys is safer, more stable, and more prosperous. Beyond those tangible benefits, this is simply a matter of right and wrong. Women and girls are human beings, full and equal in rights and dignity. They deserve to be treated that way, everywhere, every day. My Administration will continue working to make that vision a reality.

In partnership with HRINC Cambodia, the U.S. Embassy recently launched the Access Boost Mentorship program, which will connect English Access Microscholarship program alumni with a new generation of students learning English.

The English Access Microscholarship Program in Cambodia seeks to support the educational development of underprivileged students in the country through general English courses and extracurricular activities.

Graduates of the program will now have an opportunity to mentor current scholarship recipients, building a network of support and leadership across generations.

-From the Ambassador's Penh

Ive written previously that a good education is the foundation upon which future success is built.  With 70 percent of the population under the age of 30, this is especially true for Cambodia and its economic development.  The young people I meet wherever I travel in Cambodia also realize that a good education is the key to finding higher paying jobs that will provide a better life for themselves and their families.  These youth also recognize the value of learning English, which has become the international language of business and the internet.  English will continue to grow in importance for every Cambodian as the country prepares to join the ASEAN Economic Community this year and as more international companies continue to invest in building businesses here.

It should come as no surprise that teachers play a critical role in educating the young people of Cambodia.  Thats why I was so pleased to meet U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer Roger Armendariz  a young man from Kansas who is teaching at the Angkor Thom High School in Siem Reap Province.  Roger is working with students to improve their English language skills and to help teachers develop their skills and techniques.  I was also delighted to meet Thary Loeum, Rogers counterpart teacher at the school.  Thary credits her improved teaching skills to the training she received from another Peace Corps Volunteer at the Battambang Regional Teacher Training Center.  It is wonderful to see the continuing impact of Volunteers who work side by side with their Cambodian counterparts to improve teaching in the country.  The students I met at Angkor Thom were very enthusiastic about their education and learning English.  With their improved English skills, these students will be in a good position to continue their education and to compete for opportunities and employment with companies in Cambodia, the region, and the world.  I commend these students for their commitment to their education and for making progress toward a brighter future.

Roger is a member of the latest group of Peace Corps Volunteers who have answered the call to serve.  Since 2007, more than 360 Peace Corps Volunteers have served in Cambodia, teaching English and educating communities about health in 16 provinces.  During my three years as Ambassador to Cambodia, it has been truly inspiring to meet Volunteers like Roger who care deeply about the Cambodians they live and work with.

Finally, I would like to welcome Susan Dwyer, the new Peace Corps Country Director, who arrived in Cambodia last month.  Susan has lived and worked in many countries during her 20 years of humanitarian aid work.  Most recently, she was a vice-president for the International Rescue Committee.  Although this is Susans first time in Cambodia, she recently told me that she already feels this will be one of her favorite posts.  Im delighted to see that a talented manager like Susan will lead the Peace Corps in Cambodia.  For more than 50 years, nearly 220,000 Peace Corps Volunteers have worked in countries around the world to promote peace and friendship.  Im glad this commitment by the Peace Corps continues to this day.

On Monday of this week, my deputy Julie Chung spoke on behalf of the U.S. Embassy at the Road Management Workshop. She emphasized how developing a strong understanding of road management and traffic safety will save lives while also contributing to building a more connected and prosperous ASEAN region. Better and safer roads connecting the members of ASEAN will allow each country to take full advantage of economic benefits that result from the greater flow of people, goods, and services across borders. A better traffic system will also reduce the logistical costs of doing business in Cambodia, helping to attract more foreign investment, and create more and better-paying jobs for Cambodian citizens.

He also highlights a local champion for this cause:

One of Thida Khus biggest concerns  and one that I share  is the lack of women in leadership positions in Cambodia. Thida understands that if Cambodia is going to continue to develop, women must play an increasing role in all sectors of society, from business to education to politics. In order for this to happen, Cambodian women must have the same opportunities as men and to compete with men on an equal basis. This is not a problem that is limited to Cambodia but it is particularly acute here, where women hold only a small fraction of government positions.

In celebration of International Education Week (November 17-21), the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh will walk you through the 5 Steps to Studying in the United States -- one step for each day of the week.


Step One:  Research Your Options
   
If you want to study abroad in the United States, you need to start planning early, but how to begin?  There are thousands of colleges and universities in the United States -- which one is right for you?  

In order to figure this out you need to ask yourself some important questions, including:

        Why do you want to study in the United States?
        Where will you fit in best?
        Which colleges or universities will meet your needs?
        Will you need financial assistance?
        What are the application and financial aid deadlines?

It is important to give a lot of thought to your own personal reasons to study in the U.S.  These reasons may change over time, but they will help guide you in your search for the right educational programs and field of study. 

EducationUSA is a U.S. Department of State-supported network of hundreds of advising centers around the world, including in Cambodia.  The EducationUSA office in Pannasastra University provides free counseling services to all students interested in studying in the United States.

-From the Ambassadors Penh

Last month, I had the pleasure of meeting witha group of distinguished representatives of the Royal Government of Cambodia to discuss our shared interest in a critical topic  Cambodias child welfare system.  Our discussions centered on the topic of getting children out of institutions and into permanent family care.  

The importance of this issue is underscored by scientific research showing that growing up in a stable and loving family is fundamental in the development of a child.  Armed with information like this, and motivated by a passion to help children, the group I met with  representingthe Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior, and the Phnom Penh Court  is engaged in aconcerted effort to implement a child welfare system in Cambodia that puts the health, safety, and wellbeing of children first.  Im very pleased that the U.S. Embassy was able to support this groups work by sponsoring them on a visitor programin the United States. 

This month, the Cambodian delegationvisitedthe United States for a ten-day, adoptions-focused visitor program that included meetings with a wide range of child welfare and adoption subject matter experts in Washington, DC, Baltimore, Maryland, and New York City.  Between site visits and meetings with U.S. counterparts, the group had a very productive exchange in the United States.  They met with family court judges and observed court proceedings.  Theylearned about the provision of services to children at the Johns Hopkins Childrens Center.  And they met with the United States Central Authority for international adoptions, among many other activities.

Throughout their program, the Cambodian delegatesexamined best practices in child welfare and discussed strategies and practical examples for implementing the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption.  They also gained insight into the roles played by U.S. state and local child welfare authorities and social workers.  Of particular interest was the way in which these officials find permanent family placements for children outside of family care.  

I was pleased that the Cambodian delegates also took advantage of opportunities to share Cambodias successes and the challenges that remain in formulating its child welfare regulatory framework.  They were able to solicit input and advice from U.S. experts, while also giving their American counterparts greater understanding of the work being done in Cambodia to overcome obstacles.  

The visitor program is already paying dividends  reinforcing the strong ties between our two countries, inspiring new ideas, and helping to build upon the delegates ongoing work here in Cambodia.  And feedback from the delegates is helping inform the U.S. governments effort as we assist Cambodia to improve its child welfare system.  The U.S. effort includes our Children in Adversity Action Plan, coordinated by USAID in Cambodia, to promote appropriate, protective, and permanent family care.

Lets continue working together to take on the challenges ahead.  By doing that, I believe Cambodia can reach its goal of creating and implementing a child welfare system and adoption process that puts the health, safety, and wellbeing of children first.  Such a system would also fulfill Cambodias obligations under the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption, demonstrating to the world how Cambodia is prioritizing its single greatest resource, its children.",2014-10-25,10.0
